================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unvalidated input
Issue: The url provided by the user is not validated, allowing attackers to manipulate the url and potentially conduct URL redirection, URL injection, or other attacks.
Solution: Validate user input and implement proper input sanitization techniques, such as using regular expressions to ensure the url matches a specific pattern, or using a library like 'validators' to validate the url's format.

Vulnerability: Missing HTTP/HTTPS protocol validation
Issue: The url is not explicitly checked for the presence of HTTP/HTTPS protocols, which could result in unintentionally accessing insecure resources or unintended behavior.
Solution: Explicitly validate the url's protocol using string methods or regular expressions, and ensure that the protocol is either HTTP or HTTPS. If the protocol is missing, prepend the url with a default secure protocol.

Vulnerability: Insecure connection
Issue: The url is accessed using the 'urlopen' function from the 'urllib.request' module, which does not enforce HTTPS by default. This could result in data being transmitted insecurely.
Solution: Use the 'requests' library instead, which enforces HTTPS by default, or explicitly specify the 'context' parameter in the 'urlopen' function call to enforce HTTPS.

Vulnerability: Lack of SSL/TLS certificate validation
Issue: The 'urlopen' function does not explicitly validate SSL/TLS certificates, which could allow attackers to perform man-in-the-middle attacks.
Solution: Explicitly enable SSL/TLS certificate validation by setting 'context.check_hostname = True' and 'context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_REQUIRED' in the 'ssl' context when calling 'urlopen'. Alternatively, use the 'requests' library, which validates SSL/TLS certificates by default.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test valid URL with HTTP protocol
Details:
 TestName: test_load_time_for_valid_http_url
 Description: Verify the time taken to load a website with a valid HTTP URL.
Execution:
 Arrange: Initialize the URL with a valid HTTP address, e.g., "http://example.com".
 Act: Call the get_load_time function with the initialized URL.
 Assert: Assert that the returned time is greater than zero and is a float type, indicating successful loading and time measurement.
Validation: This test ensures that the function correctly measures the loading time for a valid HTTP URL.

Scenario 2: Test valid URL with HTTPS protocol
Details:
 TestName: test_load_time_for_valid_https_url
 Description: Verify the time taken to load a website with a valid HTTPS URL.
Execution:
 Arrange: Initialize the URL with a valid HTTPS address, e.g., "https://example.com".
 Act: Call the get_load_time function with the initialized URL.
 Assert: Assert that the returned time is greater than zero and is a float type, indicating successful loading and time measurement.
Validation: This test ensures that the function correctly measures the loading time for a valid HTTPS URL.

Scenario 3: Test invalid URL without protocol
Details:
 TestName: test_load_time_for_invalid_url_without_protocol
 Description: Verify the function appends HTTPS to an invalid URL without a protocol and measures the loading time.
Execution:
 Arrange: Initialize the URL with an address without a protocol, e.g., "example.com".
 Act: Call the get_load_time function with the initialized URL.
 Assert: Assert that the returned time is greater than zero and is a float type, indicating successful loading and time measurement.
Validation: This test ensures that the function correctly appends the HTTPS protocol and measures the loading time for an invalid URL without a protocol.

Scenario 4: Test URL with a non-existing domain
Details:
 TestName: test_load_time_for_non_existing_domain
 Description: Verify the function handles a URL with a non-existing domain and returns a reasonable error message or exception.
Execution:
 Arrange: Initialize the URL with a non-existing domain, e.g., "http://non-existing-domain.com".
 Act: Call the get_load_time function with the initialized URL.
 Assert: Assert that the function raises an appropriate exception or returns a default value indicating a failed loading attempt.
Validation: This test ensures that the function handles URLs with non-existing domains gracefully and does not cause the application to crash.

Scenario 5: Test URL with a slow-loading website
Details:
 TestName: test_load_time_for_slow_loading_website
 Description: Verify the function correctly measures the loading time for a slow-loading website.
Execution:
 Arrange: Initialize the URL with a slow-loading website, e.g., "https://slow-website.com".
 Act: Call the get_load_time function with the initialized URL.
 Assert: Assert that the returned time is greater than a predefined threshold, e.g., five seconds, indicating successful loading and time measurement.
Validation: This test ensures that the function correctly measures the loading time for slow-loading websites.

Scenario 6: Test URL with a fast-loading website
Details:
 TestName: test_load_time_for_fast_loading_website
 Description: Verify the function correctly measures the loading time for a fast-loading website.
Execution:
 Arrange: Initialize the URL with a fast-loading website, e.g., "https://fast-website.com".
 Act: Call the get_load_time function with the initialized URL.
 Assert: Assert that the returned time is less than a predefined threshold, e.g., one second, indicating successful loading and time measurement.
Validation: This test ensures that the function correctly measures the loading time for fast-loading websites.

Scenario 7: Test URL with a non-responsive website
Details:
 TestName: test_load_time_for_non_responsive_website
 Description: Verify the function handles a URL with a non-responsive website and returns a reasonable error message or exception.
Execution:
 Arrange: Initialize the URL with a non-responsive website, e.g., "https://non-responsive-website.com".
 Act: Call the get_load_time function with the initialized URL.
 Assert: Assert that the function raises an appropriate exception or returns a default value indicating a failed loading attempt.
Validation: This test ensures that the function handles URLs with non-responsive websites gracefully and does not cause the application to crash.
