2.**Validity of the color** : Check whether the correct color is used for food. It should be `FOO_COLOUR`.
3.  **Tag validation**  : Ensure that the tag used is "foods".
4.   **Multiple food creation**   : Test whether multiple food items can be created without any issues. This will help in ensuring that there are no conflicts with the previous food item.
