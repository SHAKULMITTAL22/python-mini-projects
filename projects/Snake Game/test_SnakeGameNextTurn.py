Scenario 1: Valid movement updates snake's position and squares
TestName: test_next_turn_valid_movement
Description: Verifies that the snake's position and squares are updated correctly when a valid move is made in any direction.

Execution:
* Arrange: Initialize a snake object and food object with valid coordinates. Set the direction to 'up', 'down', 'left', or 'right'.
* Act: Call the next\_turn function with the initialized snake and food objects.
* Assert: Check that the snake's coordinates and squares have been updated accordingly and that the snake's squares have been redrawn on the canvas.

Validation: This test is important to ensure that the snake moves correctly when a valid move is made, which is essential to the game's functionality.

Scenario 2: Snake eats food and score is updated
TestName: test_next_turn_snake_eats_food
Description: Verifies that the snake's score is incremented and a new food object is generated when the snake eats food.

Execution:
* Arrange: Initialize a snake object and food object with the same coordinates. Set the direction to a valid value.
* Act: Call the next\_turn function with the initialized snake and food objects.
* Assert: Check that the snake's score has been incremented, a new food object has been generated, and the old food object has been removed from the canvas.

Validation: This test is important to ensure that the game's scoring system and food generation work correctly when the snake eats food, which is a critical aspect of the game's functionality.

Scenario 3: Snake collides with itself and game over is called
TestName: test_next_turn_snake_collides_with_self
Description: Verifies that the game over function is called when the snake collides with itself.

Execution:
* Arrange: Initialize a snake object with a circular path that leads to a collision with itself. Set the direction to a valid value.
* Act: Call the next\_turn function with the initialized snake object and a food object with different coordinates.
* Assert: Check that the game over function has been called.

Validation: This test is important to ensure that the game over function is called correctly when the snake collides with itself, which is a critical aspect of the game's functionality.

Scenario 4: Snake collides with the canvas border and game over is called
TestName: test_next_turn_snake_collides_with_border
Description: Verifies that the game over function is called when the snake collides with the canvas border.

Execution:
* Arrange: Initialize a snake object with coordinates that lead to a collision with the canvas border. Set the direction to a valid value.
* Act: Call the next\_turn function with the initialized snake object and a food object with different coordinates.
* Assert: Check that the game over function has been called.

Validation: This test is important to ensure that the game over function is called correctly when the snake collides with the canvas border, which is a critical aspect of the game's functionality.
