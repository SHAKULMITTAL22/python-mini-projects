================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: static code analysis
Issue: the code uses tkinter which can be a potential security risk as it can be used to create malicious ui applications
Solution: use alternative gui libraries or thoroughly validate user inputs

Vulnerability: insecure direct object reference
Issue: global variables score and direction are used without proper validation, potentially leading to unauthorized data modification
Solution: use secure methods to access and modify global variables, validate user inputs

Vulnerability: cwe-20
Issue: the code does not validate user inputs, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or code injection
Solution: thoroughly validate user inputs and use secure methods to handle them

Vulnerability: cwe-79
Issue: the code uses string formatting which can be vulnerable to xss attacks
Solution: use secure string formatting methods, escape user inputs

================================================================================
Here are the pytest test scenarios for the `snake_game.next_turn` method:

**Scenario 1: Move snake up**
Details:
  TestName: test_move_up
  Description: Verify that the snake moves up when the direction is "up".
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize snake coordinates, set direction to "up", and create a food object.
  Act: Call `next_turn(snake, food)`.
  Assert: Check that the snake's head coordinates have decreased in the y-axis.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the snake moves correctly when the direction is "up", which is a fundamental aspect of the game's business logic.

**Scenario 2: Move snake down**
Details:
  TestName: test_move_down
  Description: Verify that the snake moves down when the direction is "down".
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize snake coordinates, set direction to "down", and create a food object.
  Act: Call `next_turn(snake, food)`.
  Assert: Check that the snake's head coordinates have increased in the y-axis.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the snake moves correctly when the direction is "down", which is a fundamental aspect of the game's business logic.

**Scenario 3: Move snake left**
Details:
  TestName: test_move_left
  Description: Verify that the snake moves left when the direction is "left".
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize snake coordinates, set direction to "left", and create a food object.
  Act: Call `next_turn(snake, food)`.
  Assert: Check that the snake's head coordinates have decreased in the x-axis.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the snake moves correctly when the direction is "left", which is a fundamental aspect of the game's business logic.

**Scenario 4: Move snake right**
Details:
  TestName: test_move_right
  Description: Verify that the snake moves right when the direction is "right".
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize snake coordinates, set direction to "right", and create a food object.
  Act: Call `next_turn(snake, food)`.
  Assert: Check that the snake's head coordinates have increased in the x-axis.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the snake moves correctly when the direction is "right", which is a fundamental aspect of the game's business logic.

**Scenario 5: Eat food**
Details:
  TestName: test_eat_food
  Description: Verify that the snake eats food when it reaches the food coordinates.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize snake coordinates, set direction, and create a food object with coordinates matching the snake's next position.
  Act: Call `next_turn(snake, food)`.
  Assert: Check that the score has increased, the food has been deleted, and a new food object has been created.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the snake eats food correctly, which is a critical aspect of the game's business logic.

**Scenario 6: Don't eat food**
Details:
  TestName: test_donot_eat_food
  Description: Verify that the snake doesn't eat food when it doesn't reach the food coordinates.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize snake coordinates, set direction, and create a food object with coordinates not matching the snake's next position.
  Act: Call `next_turn(snake, food)`.
  Assert: Check that the score hasn't changed, the food still exists, and the snake's tail has been removed.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the snake doesn't eat food incorrectly, which is a critical aspect of the game's business logic.

**Scenario 7: Collision detection**
Details:
  TestName: test_collision_detection
  Description: Verify that the game ends when the snake collides with itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize snake coordinates to collide with itself, set direction, and create a food object.
  Act: Call `next_turn(snake, food)`.
  Assert: Check that the game over function has been called.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the collision detection works correctly, which is a critical aspect of the game's business logic.

**Scenario 8: No collision detection**
Details:
  TestName: test_no_collision_detection
  Description: Verify that the game continues when the snake doesn't collide with itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize snake coordinates not to collide with itself, set direction, and create a food object.
  Act: Call `next_turn(snake, food)`.
  Assert: Check that the game over function hasn't been called.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the collision detection doesn't incorrectly end the game, which is a critical aspect of the game's business logic.
