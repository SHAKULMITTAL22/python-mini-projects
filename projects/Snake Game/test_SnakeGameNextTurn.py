================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The 'direction' variable is not properly validated before being used in the 'next_turn' function, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.
Solution: Validate user input or sanitize the 'direction' variable before utilizing it in the function.

Vulnerability: CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: The 'eval()' function is used in the 'check_collisions' function, which can potentially execute arbitrary code and lead to security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Replace the 'eval()' function with a safer alternative, such as 'ast.literal_eval()' or another method that doesn't involve evaluating strings as Python code.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test moving the snake up
Details:
TestName: test_next_turn_move_up
Description: Verify that the snake's position updates correctly when moving up.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize a snake object with an initial position and a direction set to "up".
Act: Call the next_turn function with the snake and food objects.
Assert: Check that the snake's first coordinate has decreased in the y-axis by SPACE_SIZE.
Validation: This test ensures that the snake's movement is correctly implemented when moving up, which is a fundamental aspect of the snake game.

Scenario 2: Test moving the snake down
Details:
TestName: test_next_turn_move_down
Description: Verify that the snake's position updates correctly when moving down.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize a snake object with an initial position and a direction set to "down".
Act: Call the next_turn function with the snake and food objects.
Assert: Check that the snake's first coordinate has increased in the y-axis by SPACE_SIZE.
Validation: This test ensures that the snake's movement is correctly implemented when moving down, which is a fundamental aspect of the snake game.

Scenario 3: Test moving the snake left
Details:
TestName: test_next_turn_move_left
Description: Verify that the snake's position updates correctly when moving left.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize a snake object with an initial position and a direction set to "left".
Act: Call the next_turn function with the snake and food objects.
Assert: Check that the snake's first coordinate has decreased in the x-axis by SPACE_SIZE.
Validation: This test ensures that the snake's movement is correctly implemented when moving left, which is a fundamental aspect of the snake game.

Scenario 4: Test moving the snake right
Details:
TestName: test_next_turn_move_right
Description: Verify that the snake's position updates correctly when moving right.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize a snake object with an initial position and a direction set to "right".
Act: Call the next_turn function with the snake and food objects.
Assert: Check that the snake's first coordinate has increased in the x-axis by SPACE_SIZE.
Validation: This test ensures that the snake's movement is correctly implemented when moving right, which is a fundamental aspect of the snake game.

Scenario 5: Test eating food
Details:
TestName: test_next_turn_eat_food
Description: Verify that the snake grows and the score increases when eating food.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize a snake object with an initial position and a direction. Place food at the same position as the snake's head.
Act: Call the next_turn function with the snake and food objects.
Assert: Check that the snake's length has increased by one, and the score has increased by one.
Validation: This test ensures that the game correctly handles the scenario where the snake eats food, which is a critical aspect of the gameplay.

Scenario 6: Test not eating food
Details:
TestName: test_next_turn_not_eat_food
Description: Verify that the snake's tail is removed when not eating food.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize a snake object with an initial position and a direction. Place food away from the snake's head.
Act: Call the next_turn function with the snake and food objects.
Assert: Check that the snake's length remains the same, and the last square of the snake has been removed.
Validation: This test ensures that the game correctly handles the scenario where the snake does not eat food, which is a critical aspect of the gameplay.

Scenario 7: Test game over when snake hits the wall
Details:
TestName: test_next_turn_game_over_wall
Description: Verify that the game ends when the snake hits the wall.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize a snake object with an initial position and a direction that will cause it to hit the wall in the next turn.
Act: Call the next_turn function with the snake and food objects.
Assert: Check that the game_over function has been called.
Validation: This test ensures that the game correctly handles the scenario where the snake hits the wall, which is a critical aspect of the gameplay.

Scenario 8: Test game over when snake hits itself
Details:
TestName: test_next_turn_game_over_self_collision
Description: Verify that the game ends when the snake hits itself.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize a snake object with a closed loop configuration, causing it to collide with itself in the next turn.
Act: Call the next_turn function with the snake and food objects.
Assert: Check that the game_over function has been called.
Validation: This test ensures that the game correctly handles the scenario where the snake hits itself, which is a critical aspect of the gameplay.
