================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not validate or sanitize the 'direction' variable, which could be controlled by user input. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the game's behavior or cause unexpected errors.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that the 'direction' variable only accepts valid values (e.g., 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right'). Reject or sanitize any invalid input.

Vulnerability: CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable
Issue: The 'direction' variable is used without being initialized. This could lead to unpredictable behavior or errors if the variable is not properly set before being accessed.
Solution: Initialize the 'direction' variable with a default value before using it in the 'next_turn' function.

Vulnerability: CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')
Issue: The code uses the 'eval' function or similar dynamic execution methods, which can allow an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code.
Solution: Avoid using 'eval' or similar functions that dynamically execute code. Instead, use safer alternatives like dictionary mapping or getattr() to map user input to predefined functions or values.

================================================================================
Here are the Pytest test scenarios for the provided `next_turn` method, focusing on validating the business logic:

```
Scenario 1: Snake moves in the specified direction
Details:
  TestName: test_snake_moves_in_specified_direction
  Description: This test verifies that the snake moves in the direction specified by the `direction` variable.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `Snake` object with a starting position and a `Food` object.
  Act: Call the `next_turn` function with the `Snake` and `Food` objects.
  Assert: Check that the snake's coordinates have been updated correctly based on the specified direction.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the snake moves in the intended direction based on user input or game logic, maintaining the core gameplay mechanics.

Scenario 2: Snake grows when it eats the food
Details:
  TestName: test_snake_grows_when_eating_food
  Description: This test verifies that the snake's length increases when it eats the food.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `Snake` object and a `Food` object with coordinates that match the snake's next position.
  Act: Call the `next_turn` function with the `Snake` and `Food` objects.
  Assert: Check that the snake's length has increased by one and that a new square has been added to the snake's squares list.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the snake's growth mechanism works correctly when it eats the food, which is a fundamental aspect of the game's progression.

Scenario 3: Food is regenerated after being eaten
Details:
  TestName: test_food_regenerates_after_being_eaten
  Description: This test verifies that a new food object is created after the snake eats the current food.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `Snake` object and a `Food` object with coordinates that match the snake's next position.
  Act: Call the `next_turn` function with the `Snake` and `Food` objects.
  Assert: Check that a new `Food` object has been created and that its coordinates differ from the previous food's coordinates.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game continues to provide new food objects for the snake to eat, maintaining the game's challenge and progression.

Scenario 4: Score increments when the snake eats the food
Details:
  TestName: test_score_increments_when_snake_eats_food
  Description: This test verifies that the player's score increases when the snake eats the food.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `Snake` object and a `Food` object with coordinates that match the snake's next position. Set an initial score value.
  Act: Call the `next_turn` function with the `Snake` and `Food` objects.
  Assert: Check that the score has incremented by one after the snake eats the food.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the scoring system works correctly, providing a sense of achievement and progress for the player.

Scenario 5: Game over when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries
Details:
  TestName: test_game_over_on_collision
  Description: This test verifies that the game ends when the snake collides with itself or the game boundaries.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `Snake` object with a position that will cause a collision in the next turn.
  Act: Call the `next_turn` function with the `Snake` object and a `Food` object.
  Assert: Check that the `game_over` function is called, indicating that the game has ended.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the collision detection mechanism works correctly, enforcing the game's rules and ending the game when appropriate.

Scenario 6: Snake's tail is removed when moving without eating food
Details:
  TestName: test_snake_tail_removed_when_moving_without_eating
  Description: This test verifies that the snake's tail is removed when it moves without eating the food.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `Snake` object and a `Food` object with coordinates that do not match the snake's next position.
  Act: Call the `next_turn` function with the `Snake` and `Food` objects.
  Assert: Check that the snake's length remains the same and that the last square has been removed from the snake's squares list.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the snake's movement is correctly implemented, maintaining its length when not eating food and preventing indefinite growth.
```

These test scenarios cover the main aspects of the `next_turn` function's business logic, including snake movement, growth, food regeneration, scoring, game over conditions, and tail removal. By executing these tests, you can validate that the core gameplay mechanics work as intended and that the game adheres to its specified rules and requirements.
