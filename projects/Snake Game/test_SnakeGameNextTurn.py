================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: insecure use of tkinter
Issue: tkinter is not designed to be secure, and its use can lead to potential security vulnerabilities, such as code execution and data tampering.
Solution: use alternative GUI libraries that are designed with security in mind, such as PyQt or wxPython.

Vulnerability: global variable
Issue: the use of global variables can lead to unintended side effects and make the code harder to reason about, making it vulnerable to attacks.
Solution: avoid using global variables and instead pass variables as arguments to functions.

Vulnerability: unchecked user input
Issue: the code does not check for invalid user input, which can lead to potential security vulnerabilities, such as code injection.
Solution: validate and sanitize user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and ranges.

Vulnerability: missing input validation
Issue: the code does not validate the input to the next_turn function, which can lead to potential security vulnerabilities, such as data tampering.
Solution: validate the input to the next_turn function to ensure it conforms to expected formats and ranges.

================================================================================
Here are the pytest test scenarios for the `snake_game.next_turn` method:

**Scenario 1: Move snake up successfully**
Details:
  TestName: test_move_snake_up
  Description: Verify that the snake moves up successfully when the direction is "up".
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a snake object with coordinates, set direction to "up", and create a food object.
  Act: Call `next_turn` with the snake and food objects as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the snake's coordinates have changed accordingly, and the score remains the same.
Validation: This test ensures that the snake moves correctly when the direction is "up", which is a fundamental aspect of the snake game.

**Scenario 2: Move snake down successfully**
Details:
  TestName: test_move_snake_down
  Description: Verify that the snake moves down successfully when the direction is "down".
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a snake object with coordinates, set direction to "down", and create a food object.
  Act: Call `next_turn` with the snake and food objects as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the snake's coordinates have changed accordingly, and the score remains the same.
Validation: This test ensures that the snake moves correctly when the direction is "down", which is a fundamental aspect of the snake game.

**Scenario 3: Move snake left successfully**
Details:
  TestName: test_move_snake_left
  Description: Verify that the snake moves left successfully when the direction is "left".
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a snake object with coordinates, set direction to "left", and create a food object.
  Act: Call `next_turn` with the snake and food objects as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the snake's coordinates have changed accordingly, and the score remains the same.
Validation: This test ensures that the snake moves correctly when the direction is "left", which is a fundamental aspect of the snake game.

**Scenario 4: Move snake right successfully**
Details:
  TestName: test_move_snake_right
  Description: Verify that the snake moves right successfully when the direction is "right".
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a snake object with coordinates, set direction to "right", and create a food object.
  Act: Call `next_turn` with the snake and food objects as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the snake's coordinates have changed accordingly, and the score remains the same.
Validation: This test ensures that the snake moves correctly when the direction is "right", which is a fundamental aspect of the snake game.

**Scenario 5: Eat food and increase score**
Details:
  TestName: test_eat_food
  Description: Verify that the snake eats food and increases the score when it collides with the food.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a snake object with coordinates, set direction, and create a food object with coordinates that match the snake's next position.
  Act: Call `next_turn` with the snake and food objects as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the score has increased by 1, and the food object has been removed.
Validation: This test ensures that the snake eats food correctly and updates the score, which is a critical aspect of the snake game.

**Scenario 6: Collision with self - game over**
Details:
  TestName: test_collision_with_self
  Description: Verify that the game ends when the snake collides with itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a snake object with coordinates that would cause a collision with itself when moving in a certain direction.
  Act: Call `next_turn` with the snake and a food object as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the game ends, and the `game_over` function is called.
Validation: This test ensures that the game ends correctly when the snake collides with itself, which is a fundamental aspect of the snake game.

**Scenario 7: No collision - continue game**
Details:
  TestName: test_no_collision
  Description: Verify that the game continues when the snake does not collide with itself or the wall.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a snake object with coordinates that do not cause a collision with itself or the wall.
  Act: Call `next_turn` with the snake and a food object as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the game continues, and the `next_turn` function is called again.
Validation: This test ensures that the game continues correctly when there is no collision, which is a fundamental aspect of the snake game.

**Scenario 8: Edge case - snake at edge of screen**
Details:
  TestName: test_snake_at_edge
  Description: Verify that the snake moves correctly when it is at the edge of the screen.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a snake object with coordinates at the edge of the screen, and set direction accordingly.
  Act: Call `next_turn` with the snake and a food object as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the snake's coordinates have changed correctly, and the score remains the same.
Validation: This test ensures that the snake moves correctly at the edge of the screen, which is an edge case in the snake game.
