================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability:  CWE-807: Reliance on Reverse DNS Resolution
Issue: The use of `tkinter` may allow an attacker to manipulate the GUI by modifying the reverse DNS resolution, leading to unintended behavior.
Solution: Use a trusted DNS resolver and ensure that the GUI is properly sanitized to prevent malicious input.

Vulnerability:  CWE-1004: Sensitive Data Stored in Clear Text
Issue: The `score` variable is stored in clear text, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access.
Solution: Encrypt sensitive data, such as scores, using a secure encryption algorithm like AES.

Vulnerability:  CWE-20: Invalid Input
Issue: The `direction` variable is not validated, allowing an attacker to inject malicious input, leading to unintended behavior.
Solution: Validate user input, including the `direction` variable, to ensure it conforms to expected values.

Vulnerability:  CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
Issue: The `canvas` and `window` objects are not properly closed, leading to resource leaks and potential denial-of-service attacks.
Solution: Ensure that all GUI resources are properly closed and released when no longer needed.

Vulnerability:  CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')
Issue: The use of `exec` or `eval` functions is not evident, but it is still a potential risk if used elsewhere in the codebase.
Solution: Avoid using `exec` or `eval` functions, and instead use safer alternatives like `ast.literal_eval` for parsing data.

================================================================================
Here are the pytest test scenarios for the `snake_game.next_turn` method:

**Scenario 1: Move snake up**
Details:
  TestName: `test_move_snake_up`
  Description: Verify that the snake moves up when the direction is "up".
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a snake object with a direction of "up" and a starting coordinate.
  Act: Call `next_turn` with the snake and food objects as arguments.
  Assert: Check that the snake's new head coordinate is one `SPACE_SIZE` above the previous head coordinate.
Validation:
  This test ensures the snake moves in the correct direction when told to move up.

**Scenario 2: Move snake down**
Details:
  TestName: `test_move_snake_down`
  Description: Verify that the snake moves down when the direction is "down".
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a snake object with a direction of "down" and a starting coordinate.
  Act: Call `next_turn` with the snake and food objects as arguments.
  Assert: Check that the snake's new head coordinate is one `SPACE_SIZE` below the previous head coordinate.
Validation:
  This test ensures the snake moves in the correct direction when told to move down.

**Scenario 3: Move snake left**
Details:
  TestName: `test_move_snake_left`
  Description: Verify that the snake moves left when the direction is "left".
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a snake object with a direction of "left" and a starting coordinate.
  Act: Call `next_turn` with the snake and food objects as arguments.
  Assert: Check that the snake's new head coordinate is one `SPACE_SIZE` to the left of the previous head coordinate.
Validation:
  This test ensures the snake moves in the correct direction when told to move left.

**Scenario 4: Move snake right**
Details:
  TestName: `test_move_snake_right`
  Description: Verify that the snake moves right when the direction is "right".
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a snake object with a direction of "right" and a starting coordinate.
  Act: Call `next_turn` with the snake and food objects as arguments.
  Assert: Check that the snake's new head coordinate is one `SPACE_SIZE` to the right of the previous head coordinate.
Validation:
  This test ensures the snake moves in the correct direction when told to move right.

**Scenario 5: Eat food**
Details:
  TestName: `test_eat_food`
  Description: Verify that the snake grows when it eats food.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a snake object and a food object at the same coordinate.
  Act: Call `next_turn` with the snake and food objects as arguments.
  Assert: Check that the snake's length has increased by one and the score has incremented.
Validation:
  This test ensures the snake grows and the score increments when the snake eats food.

**Scenario 6: Don't eat food**
Details:
  TestName: `test_dont_eat_food`
  Description: Verify that the snake doesn't grow when it doesn't eat food.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a snake object and a food object at different coordinates.
  Act: Call `next_turn` with the snake and food objects as arguments.
  Assert: Check that the snake's length remains the same and the score doesn't change.
Validation:
  This test ensures the snake doesn't grow or change score when it doesn't eat food.

**Scenario 7: Game over when colliding with itself**
Details:
  TestName: `test_game_over_collision`
  Description: Verify that the game ends when the snake collides with itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a snake object with a self-colliding coordinate.
  Act: Call `next_turn` with the snake and food objects as arguments.
  Assert: Check that the `game_over` function is called.
Validation:
  This test ensures the game ends when the snake collides with itself.

**Scenario 8: Game continues when no collision**
Details:
  TestName: `test_game_continues_no_collision`
  Description: Verify that the game continues when there is no collision.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a snake object with a non-colliding coordinate.
  Act: Call `next_turn` with the snake and food objects as arguments.
  Assert: Check that the `game_over` function is not called.
Validation:
  This test ensures the game continues when there is no collision.

These test scenarios cover the expected behavior, edge cases, and error conditions of the `snake_game.next_turn` method.
