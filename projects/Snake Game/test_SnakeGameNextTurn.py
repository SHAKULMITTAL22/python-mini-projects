================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not validate or sanitize the 'direction' variable, which could be controlled by user input. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the snake's movement and potentially cause unintended behavior or crashes.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that the 'direction' variable only accepts valid values (e.g., 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right'). Reject or sanitize any invalid input.

Vulnerability: CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable
Issue: The 'direction' variable is used without being initialized. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the variable contains an arbitrary value.
Solution: Initialize the 'direction' variable with a default value before using it in the 'next_turn' function.

Vulnerability: CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')
Issue: The code uses the 'eval' function or similar dynamic execution mechanisms, which can allow an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code.
Solution: Avoid using 'eval' or similar functions that dynamically execute code. Instead, use safer alternatives like dictionary mapping or getattr() to map user input to predefined functions or values.

Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: If the code deserializes untrusted data (e.g., from a file or network) without proper validation, it could lead to arbitrary code execution or other security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Implement strict validation and sanitization of any serialized data before deserializing it. Use secure deserialization libraries and techniques, such as using safe_load() instead of load() when deserializing YAML data.

================================================================================
Here are the Pytest test scenarios for the provided `next_turn` method:

```
Scenario 1: Snake moves in the specified direction
Details:
  TestName: test_snake_moves_in_direction
  Description: This test verifies that the snake moves in the direction specified by the global `direction` variable.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a snake object with a starting position and a food object.
  Act: Call the `next_turn` function with the snake and food objects.
  Assert: Check that the snake's coordinates have been updated correctly based on the `direction` variable.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the snake moves in the intended direction, which is a core aspect of the game's functionality and user experience.

Scenario 2: Snake grows when eating food
Details:
  TestName: test_snake_grows_when_eating_food
  Description: This test verifies that the snake grows in length when it eats the food.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a snake object and a food object with the same coordinates.
  Act: Call the `next_turn` function with the snake and food objects.
  Assert: Check that the snake's length has increased by one and that a new food object has been created.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to validate that the snake's growth mechanism works correctly, which is a fundamental aspect of the game's progression and scoring system.

Scenario 3: Score increments when snake eats food
Details:
  TestName: test_score_increments_when_snake_eats_food
  Description: This test verifies that the score is incremented when the snake eats the food.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a snake object and a food object with the same coordinates. Set the initial score to a known value.
  Act: Call the `next_turn` function with the snake and food objects.
  Assert: Check that the score has been incremented by one.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the scoring system works as intended, which is essential for tracking the player's progress and providing a sense of achievement.

Scenario 4: Snake does not grow when not eating food
Details:
  TestName: test_snake_does_not_grow_when_not_eating_food
  Description: This test verifies that the snake does not grow in length when it does not eat the food.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a snake object and a food object with different coordinates.
  Act: Call the `next_turn` function with the snake and food objects.
  Assert: Check that the snake's length remains the same and that the last coordinate and square have been removed.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the snake's growth is tied to eating food and not occurring unconditionally, maintaining the game's intended behavior.

Scenario 5: Game over when snake collides with itself or the wall
Details:
  TestName: test_game_over_when_snake_collides
  Description: This test verifies that the game ends when the snake collides with itself or the wall.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a snake object with coordinates that cause a collision (e.g., overlapping or outside the game boundaries).
  Act: Call the `next_turn` function with the snake and food objects.
  Assert: Check that the `game_over` function is called.
Validation:
  This test is critical to ensure that the collision detection mechanism works correctly and that the game ends when the snake collides, preventing the game from continuing in an invalid state.
```

These scenarios cover the main aspects of the `next_turn` function's business logic, including snake movement, growth, scoring, and game over conditions. They help ensure that the core gameplay mechanics work as intended and that the game adheres to its specified rules and requirements.
