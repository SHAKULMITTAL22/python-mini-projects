Sure, here are some test scenarios for the `__init__` method of the `Snake` class in the snake game.

1. Test with default values:
   - Input: No input is provided.
   - Expected Output: The `body_size` should be set to `BODY_PARTS`, `coordinates` should be a list of `BODY_PARTS` elements with `[0, 0]` as their value, and `squares` should be a list of `BODY_PARTS` elements.

2. Test with non-default values:
   - Input: Provide a non-default value for `BODY_PARTS`.
   - Expected Output: The `body_size` should be set to the provided value, `coordinates` should be a list of that size with `[0, 0]` as their value, and `squares` should be a list of that size.

3. Test with varying `BODY_PARTS`:
   - Input: Provide different values for `BODY_PARTS`.
   - Expected Output: The `body_size` should be set to the provided value, `coordinates` should be a list of that size with `[0, 0]` as their value, and `squares` should be a list of that size.

4. Test with varying `SPACE_SIZE`:
   - Input: Provide different values for `SPACE_SIZE`.
   - Expected Output: The `coordinates` and `squares` should be created with the provided `SPACE_SIZE`.

5. Test with varying `SNAKE_COLOR`:
   - Input: Provide different values for `SNAKE_COLOR`.
   - Expected Output: The `squares` should be created with the provided `SNAKE_COLOR`.

6. Test with varying `canvas`:
   - Input: Provide different values for `canvas`.
   - Expected Output: The `squares` should be created on the provided `canvas`.

Please note that these tests assume that the `canvas` object has a `create_rectangle` method that returns a unique identifier for each rectangle created.

Sure, here is a pytest for the `Snake.__init__` method. Please note that this test assumes that the `canvas` object has a `create_rectangle` method that returns a unique identifier for each rectangle created.

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from snake_game import Snake, canvas

def test_snake_init_default():
    snake = Snake()
    assert snake.body_size == 3
    assert snake.coordinates == [[0, 0] for _ in range(3)]
    assert len(snake.squares) == 3

def test_snake_init_non_default():
    with patch('snake_game.BODY_PARTS', new=5):
        snake = Snake()
        assert snake.body_size == 5
        assert snake.coordinates == [[0, 0] for _ in range(5)]
        assert len(snake.squares) == 5

def test_snake_init_varying_body_parts():
    with patch('snake_game.BODY_PARTS', new=7):
        snake = Snake()
        assert snake.body_size == 7
        assert snake.coordinates == [[0, 0] for _ in range(7)]
        assert len(snake.squares) == 7

def test_snake_init_varying_space_size():
    with patch('snake_game.SPACE_SIZE', new=10):
        snake = Snake()
        assert all(coord in snake.coordinates for coord in [(0, 0), (10, 0), (20, 0)])
        assert len(snake.squares) == 3

def test_snake_init_varying_snake_color():
    with patch('snake_game.SNAKE_COLOR', new='#FFFFFF'):
        snake = Snake()
        assert all(square['fill'] == '#FFFFFF' for square in snake.squares)

def test_snake_init_varying_canvas():
    mock_canvas = MagicMock()
    mock_canvas.create_rectangle.return_value = 1
    with patch('snake_game.canvas', new=mock_canvas):
        snake = Snake()
        assert all(square == 1 for square in snake.squares)
```

This test suite covers all the test scenarios you provided. It uses the `unittest.mock.patch` function to mock the `BODY_PARTS`, `SPACE_SIZE`, `SNAKE_COLOR`, and `canvas` variables, and the `unittest.mock.MagicMock` function to mock the `create_rectangle` method of the `canvas` object.
