================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The 'random' module is used for generating random numbers, which is not suitable for security-critical applications. An attacker could potentially predict the sequence of numbers generated by the module, leading to security vulnerabilities.
Solution: For security-critical applications, consider using the 'secrets' module, which is designed for generating cryptographically strong pseudo-random numbers.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not perform proper input validation, which may lead to security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
Solution: Ensure that all inputs are validated and sanitized before processing. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when working with databases, and escape all user inputs in contexts where they might be interpreted as code or markup.

Vulnerability: CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
Issue: The code does not properly validate user-supplied file names or paths, which may lead to security vulnerabilities such as directory traversal attacks.
Solution: Ensure that user-supplied file names or paths are properly validated and sanitized. Use a whitelist of allowed characters and enforce a maximum path length. Consider using a library or framework that provides secure file handling functionality.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate initial snake body size
TestName: test_initial_body_size
Description: Verify that the initial snake body size is set correctly.

Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Snake class.
Act: Check the value of the body_size attribute.
Assert: Assert that the body_size attribute is equal to the expected value (BODY_PARTS).

Validation:
This test is important to ensure that the initial snake body size is set correctly, which affects the game's difficulty and behavior.

Scenario 2: Validate initial snake coordinates
TestName: test_initial_coordinates
Description: Verify that the initial snake coordinates are set correctly.

Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Snake class.
Act: Check the value of the coordinates attribute.
Assert: Assert that the coordinates attribute is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents an (x, y) coordinate pair.

Validation:
This test is important to ensure that the initial snake coordinates are set correctly, which affects the snake's movement and position on the game board.

Scenario 3: Validate initial snake squares
TestName: test_initial_squares
Description: Verify that the initial snake squares are created and added to the squares attribute.

Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Snake class.
Act: Check the value of the squares attribute.
Assert: Assert that the squares attribute is a list of canvas.create_rectangle() objects.

Validation:
This test is important to ensure that the initial snake squares are created and added to the squares attribute, which is used to draw the snake on the game board.

Scenario 4: Validate initial snake position on the game board
TestName: test_initial_snake_position
Description: Verify that the initial snake position is set correctly on the game board.

Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Snake class and draw the game board.
Act: Check the position of the snake squares on the game board.
Assert: Assert that the snake squares are positioned at the (0, 0) coordinate on the game board.

Validation:
This test is important to ensure that the initial snake position is set correctly on the game board, which affects the game's starting state and the snake's movement.

Scenario 5: Validate snake body size after a single move
TestName: test_single_move_body_size
Description: Verify that the snake body size remains the same after a single move.

Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Snake class, set the snake's movement direction, and make a single move.
Act: Check the value of the body_size attribute after the move.
Assert: Assert that the body_size attribute remains the same after the move.

Validation:
This test is important to ensure that the snake body size remains the same after a single move, which affects the game's behavior and the snake's movement.

Scenario 6: Validate snake body size after eating a food item
TestName: test_eat_food_body_size
Description: Verify that the snake body size increases after eating a food item.

Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Snake class, set the snake's movement direction, make a single move, and simulate eating a food item.
Act: Check the value of the body_size attribute after eating the food item.
Assert: Assert that the body_size attribute increases by 1 after eating the food item.

Validation:
This test is important to ensure that the snake body size increases after eating a food item, which affects the game's behavior and the snake's growth.

Scenario 7: Validate snake body size after colliding with itself
TestName: test_self_collision_body_size
Description: Verify that the snake body size decreases after colliding with itself.

Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Snake class, set the snake's movement direction, make a single move, and simulate colliding with the snake's own body.
Act: Check the value of the body_size attribute after the collision.
Assert: Assert that the body_size attribute decreases by 1 after the collision.

Validation:
This test is important to ensure that the snake body size decreases after colliding with itself, which is a game-over condition and affects the game's behavior and the snake's movement.

Scenario 8: Validate snake body size after colliding with the game board boundaries
TestName: test_boundary_collision_body_size
Description: Verify that the snake body size decreases after colliding with the game board boundaries.

Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Snake class, set the snake's movement direction, and simulate colliding with the game board boundaries.
Act: Check the value of the body_size attribute after the collision.
Assert: Assert that the body_size attribute decreases by 1 after the collision.

Validation:
This test is important to ensure that the snake body size decreases after colliding with the game board boundaries, which is a game-over condition and affects the game's behavior and the snake's movement.
