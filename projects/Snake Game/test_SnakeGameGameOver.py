Scenario 1: Test if the game_over function deletes all objects on the canvas before displaying the game over text.
```python
TestName: test_game_over_deletes_all_objects
Description: Verify that the game_over function removes all existing objects before displaying the "GAME OVER" message.

Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Initialize the canvas.
    - Create some objects on the canvas.
  Act:
    - Call the game_over function.
  Assert:
    - Check if all objects have been deleted from the canvas.
    - Verify that the "GAME OVER" text is displayed on the canvas.

Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the game_over function properly resets the game state by removing all existing objects before displaying the game over message.
```

Scenario 2: Test if the game_over function displays the game over text in the correct position, font, and color.
```python
TestName: test_game_over_text_appearance
Description: Verify that the game_over function displays the "GAME OVER" text in the correct position, font, and color.

Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Initialize the canvas.
  Act:
    - Call the game_over function.
  Assert:
    - Check if the "GAME OVER" text is displayed in the center of the canvas.
    - Verify that the font of the text is 'consolas' with a size of 70.
    - Confirm that the color of the text is red.

Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the game_over function correctly displays the game over message with the specified visual properties.
```

Scenario 3: Test if the game_over function assigns the correct tag to the game over text.
```python
TestName: test_game_over_text_tag_assignment
Description: Verify that the game_over function assigns the correct tag to the "GAME OVER" text.

Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Initialize the canvas.
  Act:
    - Call the game_over function.
  Assert:
    - Check if the "GAME OVER" text has the tag "gameover".

Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the game_over function correctly assigns the tag "gameover" to the game over text, allowing for easy manipulation and identification.
```

Scenario 4: Test if the game_over function handles an empty canvas.
```python
TestName: test_game_over_empty_canvas
Description: Verify that the game_over function handles an empty canvas without raising any errors.

Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Initialize the canvas.
  Act:
    - Call the game_over function.
  Assert:
    - Confirm that the function executes without raising any errors.

Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the game_over function can handle an empty canvas and does not rely on the presence of existing objects for its execution.
