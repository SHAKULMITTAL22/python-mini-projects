================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CVE-2021-28692
Issue: The `tkinter` library is susceptible to arbitrary code execution during deserialization via the `getdouble()` function.
Solution: Avoid using `getdouble()` function when deserializing data. Use `ast.literal_eval()` or JSON library instead.

Vulnerability: CWE-327
Issue: Using `random` library for any security-related purposes, such as generating random numbers, may lead to predictable sequences.
Solution: Replace `random` library with `secrets` for generating secure random numbers.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test if the game_over function displays text on the canvas
TestName: test_game_over_displays_text
Description: Verify that the game_over function correctly displays the "GAME OVER" text on the canvas when called.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the canvas object with appropriate dimensions.
Act: Call the game_over function.
Assert: Check if the "gameover" tag exists in the canvas, indicating that the text has been added.
Validation: This test is important to ensure that the game_over function correctly displays the end-of-game message to the user.

Scenario 2: Test if the game_over function deletes all existing objects on the canvas
TestName: test_game_over_deletes_all_objects
Description: Verify that the game_over function removes all existing objects from the canvas before displaying the "GAME OVER" text.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the canvas object with appropriate dimensions and add some objects to it.
Act: Call the game_over function.
Assert: Check if the canvas is empty (i.e., no objects with tags other than "gameover" exist).
Validation: This test ensures that the game_over function clears the canvas before displaying the end-of-game message, providing a clean visual experience for the user.

Scenario 3: Test if the game_over function uses the correct font and color for the "GAME OVER" text
TestName: test_game_over_uses_correct_font_and_color
Description: Verify that the game_over function uses the correct font and color for the "GAME OVER" text.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the canvas object with appropriate dimensions.
Act: Call the game_over function.
Assert: Check if the "gameover" text has the correct font ('consolas', 70) and color ("red").
Validation: This test ensures that the game_over function adheres to the specified visual design requirements, enhancing the user experience.

Scenario 4: Test if the game_over function centers the "GAME OVER" text on the canvas
TestName: test_game_over_centers_text_on_canvas
Description: Verify that the game_over function centers the "GAME OVER" text on the canvas.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the canvas object with appropriate dimensions.
Act: Call the game_over function.
Assert: Check the position of the "gameover" text and ensure it is centered horizontally and vertically on the canvas.
Validation: This test ensures that the game_over function correctly positions the end-of-game message, providing a visually appealing user interface.

Scenario 5: Test if the game_over function does not affect the canvas if it is already empty
TestName: test_game_over_does_not_change_empty_canvas
Description: Verify that the game_over function does not alter the canvas if it is already empty.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the canvas object with appropriate dimensions and ensure it is empty.
Act: Call the game_over function.
Assert: Check if the canvas remains unchanged (i.e., no objects with tags other than "gameover" exist).
Validation: This test ensures that the game_over function does not unintentionally modify the canvas when it is already empty, preserving the game state and preventing unnecessary visual changes.
