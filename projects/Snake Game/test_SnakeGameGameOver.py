================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: cwe-20
Issue: unchecked user input may lead to code injection
Solution: validate and sanitize user input before using it with tkinter

Vulnerability: cwe-789
Issue: use of wildcard imports (from tkinter import *) can lead to namespace pollution
Solution: import specific modules or functions instead of using wildcard imports

Vulnerability: cwe-862
Issue: unvalidated user input can lead to denial of service (dos) attacks
Solution: validate user input and handle exceptions properly to prevent dos attacks

================================================================================
Here are some pytest test scenarios for the `game_over` method:

**Scenario 1: Successful game over display**
Details:
  TestName: `test_game_over_display`
  Description: Verify that the `game_over` function correctly displays the "GAME OVER" text on the canvas.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the canvas object and ensure it is visible.
  Act: Call the `game_over` function.
  Assert: Check that the "GAME OVER" text is present on the canvas with the specified font, size, and color.
Validation: This test ensures the primary functionality of the `game_over` function, which is to display the game over message.

**Scenario 2: Canvas clearing**
Details:
  TestName: `test_canvas_clearing`
  Description: Verify that the `game_over` function clears the canvas before displaying the game over message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the canvas object, draw some shapes or text on it, and ensure it is visible.
  Act: Call the `game_over` function.
  Assert: Check that the canvas is cleared, and only the "GAME OVER" text is present.
Validation: This test ensures that the `game_over` function properly clears the canvas, removing any previous game state or elements.

**Scenario 3: Text position and alignment**
Details:
  TestName: `test_text_position_and_alignment`
  Description: Verify that the "GAME OVER" text is centered horizontally and vertically on the canvas.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the canvas object and ensure it is visible.
  Act: Call the `game_over` function.
  Assert: Check that the "GAME OVER" text is positioned at the center of the canvas, both horizontally and vertically.
Validation: This test ensures that the `game_over` function correctly positions the game over message, making it easily readable.

**Scenario 4: Font and text size**
Details:
  TestName: `test_font_and_text_size`
  Description: Verify that the "GAME OVER" text is displayed with the correct font and size.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the canvas object and ensure it is visible.
  Act: Call the `game_over` function.
  Assert: Check that the "GAME OVER" text is displayed with the specified font (Consolas) and size (70).
Validation: This test ensures that the `game_over` function correctly sets the font and size of the game over message, conforming to the game's visual design.

**Scenario 5: Text color**
Details:
  TestName: `test_text_color`
  Description: Verify that the "GAME OVER" text is displayed with the correct color (red).
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the canvas object and ensure it is visible.
  Act: Call the `game_over` function.
  Assert: Check that the "GAME OVER" text is displayed with the specified color (red).
Validation: This test ensures that the `game_over` function correctly sets the color of the game over message, making it visually prominent.

**Scenario 6: Multiple calls**
Details:
  TestName: `test_multiple_calls`
  Description: Verify that the `game_over` function can be called multiple times without causing issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the canvas object and ensure it is visible.
  Act: Call the `game_over` function multiple times.
  Assert: Check that the "GAME OVER" text is still displayed correctly, and the canvas is not affected by repeated calls.
Validation: This test ensures that the `game_over` function is robust and can be called multiple times without causing unintended behavior or errors.

These scenarios cover the expected behavior, edge cases, and error conditions for the `game_over` function, ensuring that it correctly displays the game over message and behaves as intended.
