================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: The 'import random' statement is executed based on untrusted input, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution if the input is crafted maliciously.
Solution: Avoid executing import statements based on user-controlled input. If dynamic imports are necessary, thoroughly validate and sanitize the input before using it.

Vulnerability: CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information
Issue: The 'game_over' function displays the 'GAME OVER' text without proper validation or context, which could be misleading or confusing to users if triggered unexpectedly.
Solution: Ensure that critical information, such as game over messages, is displayed in a clear and unambiguous manner. Provide appropriate context and explanations to avoid user confusion.

Vulnerability: CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
Issue: The code does not impose any limits on the canvas size or the number of elements created, potentially leading to resource exhaustion or denial-of-service conditions.
Solution: Implement proper resource limits and throttling mechanisms to prevent excessive resource consumption. Validate and constrain user input related to canvas size and the number of elements created.

================================================================================
Here are the Pytest test scenarios for the provided `game_over` method:

Scenario 1: Verify that the game over text is displayed correctly
Details:
  TestName: test_game_over_text_displayed
  Description: This test verifies that the game over text is correctly displayed on the canvas when the `game_over` function is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock canvas object with the necessary methods (`delete`, `create_text`, `winfo_width`, `winfo_height`).
  Act: Call the `game_over` function.
  Assert: Check that the `delete` method is called with the `ALL` parameter, and the `create_text` method is called with the correct arguments (text, font, fill, tag).
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the game over message is properly displayed to the user when the game ends. It verifies that the canvas is cleared and the text is created with the expected content and formatting.

Scenario 2: Verify that the game over text is centered on the canvas
Details:
  TestName: test_game_over_text_centered
  Description: This test verifies that the game over text is positioned at the center of the canvas when the `game_over` function is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock canvas object with the necessary methods (`delete`, `create_text`, `winfo_width`, `winfo_height`).
  Act: Call the `game_over` function.
  Assert: Check that the `create_text` method is called with the correct coordinates (canvas width/2, canvas height/2) to center the text on the canvas.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game over message is visually centered on the canvas, providing a better user experience. It verifies that the text is positioned correctly based on the canvas dimensions.

Scenario 3: Verify that the canvas is cleared before displaying the game over text
Details:
  TestName: test_canvas_cleared_before_game_over
  Description: This test verifies that the canvas is cleared of any existing elements before displaying the game over text.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock canvas object with the necessary methods (`delete`, `create_text`, `winfo_width`, `winfo_height`).
  Act: Call the `game_over` function.
  Assert: Check that the `delete` method is called with the `ALL` parameter before the `create_text` method is called.
Validation:
  This test ensures that any previous game elements or graphics are removed from the canvas before displaying the game over message. It helps to maintain a clean and consistent display when the game ends.

Scenario 4: Verify that the game over text is tagged correctly
Details:
  TestName: test_game_over_text_tagged
  Description: This test verifies that the game over text is tagged with the correct identifier when created on the canvas.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock canvas object with the necessary methods (`delete`, `create_text`, `winfo_width`, `winfo_height`).
  Act: Call the `game_over` function.
  Assert: Check that the `create_text` method is called with the `tag` parameter set to "gameover".
Validation:
  Tagging the game over text allows for easy identification and manipulation of the text element if needed. This test ensures that the text is properly tagged, facilitating any future modifications or interactions with the game over message.

These test scenarios cover the essential aspects of the `game_over` function, including the display of the game over text, its positioning, canvas clearing, and tagging. They ensure that the function behaves as expected and meets the business requirements for displaying the game over message when the game ends.
