================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: cwe-20
Issue: unvalidated input in tkinter can lead to code execution
Solution: validate user input and use safe formatting options with tkinter

Vulnerability: cwe-388
Issue: potential race condition in game_over function
Solution: use thread-safe operations and locking mechanisms to prevent race conditions

Vulnerability: cwe-829
Issue: importing all modules from tkinter can lead to namespace pollution
Solution: import only necessary modules and avoid using wildcard imports

Vulnerability: cwe-755
Issue: using random module without proper initialization can lead to predictable output
Solution: properly initialize the random module with a secure seed

================================================================================
Here are the pytest test scenarios for the `game_over` method:

**Scenario 1: Successful Game Over**
Details:
  TestName: test_game_over_success
  Description: Verifies that the `game_over` method correctly displays the "GAME OVER" message on the canvas.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `canvas` object and ensure it is in a valid state.
  Act: Call the `game_over` method.
  Assert: Verify that the "GAME OVER" text is displayed on the canvas with the correct font, size, and color.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the primary functionality of the `game_over` method is working as expected, which is to display the game over message.

**Scenario 2: Canvas Not Initialized**
Details:
  TestName: test_game_over_no_canvas
  Description: Verifies that the `game_over` method raises an error when the `canvas` object is not initialized.
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not initialize the `canvas` object.
  Act: Call the `game_over` method.
  Assert: Verify that a `NameError` or `AttributeError` is raised.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `game_over` method correctly handles the scenario where the `canvas` object is not initialized.

**Scenario 3: Canvas Already Cleared**
Details:
  TestName: test_game_over_canvas_already_cleared
  Description: Verifies that the `game_over` method still displays the "GAME OVER" message even if the canvas is already cleared.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `canvas` object and clear it using `canvas.delete(ALL)`.
  Act: Call the `game_over` method.
  Assert: Verify that the "GAME OVER" text is still displayed on the canvas with the correct font, size, and color.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `game_over` method correctly handles the scenario where the canvas is already cleared.

**Scenario 4: Canvas Width or Height is Zero**
Details:
  TestName: test_game_over_canvas_zero_size
  Description: Verifies that the `game_over` method still displays the "GAME OVER" message even if the canvas width or height is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `canvas` object with a width or height of zero.
  Act: Call the `game_over` method.
  Assert: Verify that the "GAME OVER" text is still displayed on the canvas with the correct font, size, and color.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `game_over` method correctly handles the scenario where the canvas has a zero width or height.

**Scenario 5: Multiple Calls to Game Over**
Details:
  TestName: test_game_over_multiple_calls
  Description: Verifies that the `game_over` method correctly handles multiple calls without raising an error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `canvas` object.
  Act: Call the `game_over` method multiple times.
  Assert: Verify that no error is raised and the "GAME OVER" text is still displayed on the canvas with the correct font, size, and color.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `game_over` method correctly handles multiple calls without causing any issues.
