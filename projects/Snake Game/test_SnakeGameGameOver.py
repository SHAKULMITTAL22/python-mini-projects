================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: The 'import *' syntax is used to import the tkinter module, which can potentially allow importing malicious code from the module.
Solution: Avoid using 'import *' and instead explicitly import only the required classes/functions from the tkinter module, like 'from tkinter import Tk, Canvas, ALL'.

Vulnerability: CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
Issue: The 'canvas.winfo_width()/2' and 'canvas.winfo_height()/2' expressions rely on the dimensions of the canvas, which could be manipulated by untrusted input.
Solution: Validate and sanitize the canvas dimensions before using them in security-sensitive operations. Ensure they are within expected bounds.

Vulnerability: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Issue: The font name 'consolas' and size '70' are hardcoded in the code. If these need to be changed, the code would have to be modified.
Solution: Consider externalizing such configuration values into a separate configuration file or using constants defined at the top of the code file for easier maintainability.

================================================================================
Here are the Pytest test scenarios for the provided `game_over` method:

Scenario 1: Verify that the game over text is displayed correctly
Details:
  TestName: test_game_over_text_displayed
  Description: This test verifies that the game over text is correctly displayed on the canvas when the `game_over` function is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock canvas object with the necessary methods (`delete`, `create_text`, `winfo_width`, `winfo_height`).
  Act: Call the `game_over` function.
  Assert: Check that the `delete` method is called with the `ALL` parameter, and the `create_text` method is called with the correct arguments (text, font, fill, tag).
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the game over message is properly displayed to the user when the game ends. It verifies that the canvas is cleared and the text is created with the expected content and formatting.

Scenario 2: Verify that the game over text is centered on the canvas
Details:
  TestName: test_game_over_text_centered
  Description: This test verifies that the game over text is positioned at the center of the canvas when the `game_over` function is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock canvas object with the necessary methods (`delete`, `create_text`, `winfo_width`, `winfo_height`).
  Act: Call the `game_over` function.
  Assert: Check that the `create_text` method is called with the correct coordinates (canvas width/2, canvas height/2) to center the text on the canvas.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game over message is visually centered on the canvas, providing a better user experience. It verifies that the text is positioned correctly based on the canvas dimensions.

Scenario 3: Verify that the canvas is cleared before displaying the game over text
Details:
  TestName: test_canvas_cleared_before_game_over
  Description: This test verifies that the canvas is cleared of any existing elements before displaying the game over text.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock canvas object with the necessary methods (`delete`, `create_text`, `winfo_width`, `winfo_height`).
  Act: Call the `game_over` function.
  Assert: Check that the `delete` method is called with the `ALL` parameter before the `create_text` method is called.
Validation:
  This test ensures that any previous game elements or graphics are removed from the canvas before displaying the game over message. It helps maintain a clean and uncluttered display when the game ends.

Scenario 4: Verify that the game over text is tagged correctly
Details:
  TestName: test_game_over_text_tagged
  Description: This test verifies that the game over text is tagged with the correct identifier when created on the canvas.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock canvas object with the necessary methods (`delete`, `create_text`, `winfo_width`, `winfo_height`).
  Act: Call the `game_over` function.
  Assert: Check that the `create_text` method is called with the `tag` parameter set to "gameover".
Validation:
  Tagging the game over text with a specific identifier allows for easy manipulation or removal of the text if needed. This test ensures that the text is properly tagged, facilitating any future operations or modifications related to the game over message.

These test scenarios cover the essential aspects of the `game_over` function, including the display of the game over text, its positioning, canvas clearing, and tagging. They help ensure that the function behaves as expected and meets the business requirements related to the game over functionality.
