Sure, here are some test scenarios for the `change_direction` function:

1. Test with valid input:
   - Test with 'left', 'right', 'up', and 'down'. Ensure that the direction is updated correctly when the new direction is not the same as the current direction.
   - Test with the current direction. Ensure that the direction remains the same when the new direction is the same as the current direction.

2. Test with invalid input:
   - Test with an empty string. Ensure that the direction remains the same when an invalid direction is provided.
   - Test with a number. Ensure that the direction remains the same when a non-string input is provided.
   - Test with a special character. Ensure that the direction remains the same when a non-alphabetic character is provided.

3. Test with edge cases:
   - Test with a string that is not 'left', 'right', 'up', or 'down'. Ensure that the direction remains the same when an invalid direction is provided.
   - Test with a string that is 'left' or 'right' when the current direction is 'up' or 'down', or vice versa. Ensure that the direction remains the same when the new direction is the same as the current direction but in the opposite direction.

4. Test with varying input:
   - Test with a variety of valid directions. Ensure that the direction is updated correctly when the new direction is not the same as the current direction.
   - Test with a variety of invalid directions. Ensure that the direction remains the same when an invalid direction is provided.

Please note that these test scenarios are based on the assumption that the `direction` variable is a global variable and is initially set to 'right'. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the test scenarios accordingly.

Sure, here is a pytest for the `change_direction` function:

```python
import pytest
from snake_game import change_direction

# Test with valid input
def test_change_direction_valid():
    global direction
    direction = 'right'
    change_direction('left')
    assert direction == 'left'
    direction = 'right'
    change_direction('down')
    assert direction == 'down'

# Test with invalid input
def test_change_direction_invalid():
    global direction
    direction = 'right'
    change_direction('')
    assert direction == 'right'
    change_direction(123)
    assert direction == 'right'
    change_direction('$')
    assert direction == 'right'

# Test with edge cases
def test_change_direction_edge_cases():
    global direction
    direction = 'right'
    change_direction('up')
    assert direction == 'right'
    direction = 'left'
    change_direction('left')
    assert direction == 'right'

# Test with varying input
def test_change_direction_various_inputs():
    global direction
    direction = 'right'
    change_direction('left')
    assert direction == 'left'
    change_direction('up')
    assert direction == 'up'
    change_direction('down')
    assert direction == 'down'
    change_direction('right')
    assert direction == 'down'
```

This pytest covers the scenarios you mentioned. It tests the function with valid inputs, invalid inputs, edge cases, and varying inputs. The tests are separated into different functions for clarity. The global variable `direction` is used to keep track of the current direction. The `change_direction` function is called with the new direction as an argument, and the result is checked against the expected direction.
