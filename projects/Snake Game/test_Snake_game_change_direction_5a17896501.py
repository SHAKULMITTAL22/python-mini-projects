 1. **Validate direction change**:
	* Input: `new direction` is '`left`'
* Expected output: If `direction` was not '`'right'`', then `change direction()` should change ` direction ` to '``left`'.
2. Validate **direction change with invalid input**
   * Input : ` new direction`` is `'invalid'`
      * Expectation : Since `' invalid'` is an invalid direction, ` change direction ()` should not change the `  direction`.
3. Verify **invalid direction** :
     *  Input  :  `   new  directions`` are `'left'` and `'right'`. 
       *   Expection :   Since  `' left'`  and  ' `right` ' are invalid directions,  ``change  directio()``  should  not  change  the  ```direction``` .
4. Check **valid direction with same input direction **:  *Input :*  new directions are ' left ' and ' right '. *Expectations : *Since ' ' is a valid direction and the current direction is the same as the new one, change directi on () should do nothing.
5. Test **change of direction from ' up ' to' down '**  **Input** **Expected Output** *new directions* are *' up'* and *''down''.* *change direct i on()* should *not* change *direction* . *Comments* : This test case is to ensure that the function handles the case where the direction changes from *up* to *down* correctly.

 6.  Check  valid  input  with  different  current  &  expected  output  (new  direc tion) : ** Input ** : new dire ction is * ' down' * ** Expec tation **  Since * ''down'' * is valid and current dire  ctio n is not the sam e as new di rection , * change directio () * should ch ange * direction * to  '' down'' . ** Comments ** This t est case ensures that change di rec tio() handles valid input with different current and expected output correctly .
