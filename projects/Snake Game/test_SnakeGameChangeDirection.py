================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The code does not properly validate or sanitize the 'new_direction' parameter in the change_direction() function. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the 'direction' variable and potentially access or modify unintended resources.
Solution: Implement strict input validation and sanitization for the 'new_direction' parameter. Ensure that only valid and expected values are accepted, such as 'left', 'right', 'up', and 'down'. Reject or sanitize any input that does not conform to the expected format.

Vulnerability: CWE-284: Improper Access Control
Issue: The code uses a global variable 'direction' to store the current direction. This variable is directly accessible and modifiable from anywhere in the code, which could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the direction state.
Solution: Encapsulate the 'direction' variable within a class or a limited scope to restrict direct access. Provide controlled methods or functions to modify the direction state, ensuring proper access control and preventing unauthorized modifications.

================================================================================
Here are the Pytest test scenarios for the provided `change_direction` function:

Scenario 1: Valid Direction Change
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_direction_change
  Description: This test verifies that the `change_direction` function correctly updates the global `direction` variable when a valid new direction is provided, and the new direction is not opposite to the current direction.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the initial value of the global `direction` variable to a known direction (e.g., 'right').
  Act: Call the `change_direction` function with a valid new direction (e.g., 'up').
  Assert: Check that the global `direction` variable is updated to the new direction.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the `change_direction` function correctly updates the snake's direction when a valid new direction is provided, allowing the snake to move in the desired direction during gameplay.

Scenario 2: Invalid Opposite Direction Change
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_opposite_direction_change
  Description: This test verifies that the `change_direction` function does not update the global `direction` variable when the new direction is opposite to the current direction.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the initial value of the global `direction` variable to a known direction (e.g., 'left').
  Act: Call the `change_direction` function with the opposite direction (e.g., 'right').
  Assert: Check that the global `direction` variable remains unchanged.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the snake cannot reverse its direction, which is typically not allowed in snake game mechanics. The `change_direction` function should ignore the new direction if it is opposite to the current direction.

Scenario 3: Invalid Direction Input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_direction_input
  Description: This test verifies that the `change_direction` function handles invalid direction inputs gracefully and does not update the global `direction` variable.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the initial value of the global `direction` variable to a known direction (e.g., 'up').
  Act: Call the `change_direction` function with an invalid direction input (e.g., 'invalid').
  Assert: Check that the global `direction` variable remains unchanged.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the `change_direction` function does not modify the snake's direction when an invalid direction input is provided. It helps maintain the integrity of the game state and prevents unexpected behavior.

Scenario 4: Consecutive Valid Direction Changes
Details:
  TestName: test_consecutive_valid_direction_changes
  Description: This test verifies that the `change_direction` function correctly updates the global `direction` variable when consecutive valid direction changes are made.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the initial value of the global `direction` variable to a known direction (e.g., 'right').
  Act: Call the `change_direction` function with a valid new direction (e.g., 'up'), followed by another valid direction (e.g., 'left').
  Assert: Check that the global `direction` variable is updated to the last valid direction provided.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `change_direction` function correctly handles consecutive valid direction changes, allowing the snake to smoothly navigate through the game board based on the player's inputs.

These test scenarios cover the essential aspects of the `change_direction` function's business logic, including valid direction changes, invalid opposite direction changes, handling of invalid direction inputs, and consecutive valid direction changes. They help ensure the correctness and reliability of the snake's movement based on the provided direction inputs.
