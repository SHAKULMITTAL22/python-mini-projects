================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: global variable usage
Issue: the use of global variables can lead to unexpected behavior and make the code harder to debug and understand
Solution: avoid using global variables and instead pass variables as arguments to functions

Vulnerability: tkinter import
Issue: importing entire tkinter module can lead to potential security risks due to the large attack surface
Solution: only import the necessary modules or functions from tkinter instead of importing the entire module

Vulnerability: insecure random number generation
Issue: using the random module without proper seeding can lead to predictable and insecure random numbers
Solution: use the secrets module instead of random for generating cryptographically secure random numbers

================================================================================
Here are the pytest test scenarios for the `change_direction` method:

**Scenario 1: Changing direction to left when current direction is not right**
Details:
  TestName: `test_change_direction_to_left`
  Description: Verify that the direction is updated to 'left' when the current direction is not 'right'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `direction` variable to a value other than 'right' (e.g., 'up').
  Act: Call `change_direction('left')`.
  Assert: Verify that `direction` is now 'left'.
Validation: This test ensures that the function correctly updates the direction when the new direction is 'left' and the current direction is not 'right', which is a fundamental aspect of the snake game's movement logic.

**Scenario 2: Not changing direction to left when current direction is right**
Details:
  TestName: `test_not_change_direction_to_left_when_right`
  Description: Verify that the direction remains unchanged when trying to change to 'left' while the current direction is 'right'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `direction` variable to 'right'.
  Act: Call `change_direction('left')`.
  Assert: Verify that `direction` is still 'right'.
Validation: This test ensures that the function correctly preserves the current direction when attempting to change to 'left' while the current direction is 'right', preventing illogical movements in the game.

**Scenario 3: Changing direction to right when current direction is not left**
Details:
  TestName: `test_change_direction_to_right`
  Description: Verify that the direction is updated to 'right' when the current direction is not 'left'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `direction` variable to a value other than 'left' (e.g., 'down').
  Act: Call `change_direction('right')`.
  Assert: Verify that `direction` is now 'right'.
Validation: This test ensures that the function correctly updates the direction when the new direction is 'right' and the current direction is not 'left', which is a fundamental aspect of the snake game's movement logic.

**Scenario 4: Not changing direction to right when current direction is left**
Details:
  TestName: `test_not_change_direction_to_right_when_left`
  Description: Verify that the direction remains unchanged when trying to change to 'right' while the current direction is 'left'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `direction` variable to 'left'.
  Act: Call `change_direction('right')`.
  Assert: Verify that `direction` is still 'left'.
Validation: This test ensures that the function correctly preserves the current direction when attempting to change to 'right' while the current direction is 'left', preventing illogical movements in the game.

**Scenario 5: Changing direction to up when current direction is not down**
Details:
  TestName: `test_change_direction_to_up`
  Description: Verify that the direction is updated to 'up' when the current direction is not 'down'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `direction` variable to a value other than 'down' (e.g., 'left').
  Act: Call `change_direction('up')`.
  Assert: Verify that `direction` is now 'up'.
Validation: This test ensures that the function correctly updates the direction when the new direction is 'up' and the current direction is not 'down', which is a fundamental aspect of the snake game's movement logic.

**Scenario 6: Not changing direction to up when current direction is down**
Details:
  TestName: `test_not_change_direction_to_up_when_down`
  Description: Verify that the direction remains unchanged when trying to change to 'up' while the current direction is 'down'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `direction` variable to 'down'.
  Act: Call `change_direction('up')`.
  Assert: Verify that `direction` is still 'down'.
Validation: This test ensures that the function correctly preserves the current direction when attempting to change to 'up' while the current direction is 'down', preventing illogical movements in the game.

**Scenario 7: Changing direction to down when current direction is not up**
Details:
  TestName: `test_change_direction_to_down`
  Description: Verify that the direction is updated to 'down' when the current direction is not 'up'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `direction` variable to a value other than 'up' (e.g., 'right').
  Act: Call `change_direction('down')`.
  Assert: Verify that `direction` is now 'down'.
Validation: This test ensures that the function correctly updates the direction when the new direction is 'down' and the current direction is not 'up', which is a fundamental aspect of the snake game's movement logic.

**Scenario 8: Not changing direction to down when current direction is up**
Details:
  TestName: `test_not_change_direction_to_down_when_up`
  Description: Verify that the direction remains unchanged when trying to change to 'down' while the current direction is 'up'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `direction` variable to 'up'.
  Act: Call `change_direction('down')`.
  Assert: Verify that `direction` is still 'up'.
Validation: This test ensures that the function correctly preserves the current direction when attempting to change to 'down' while the current direction is 'up', preventing illogical movements in the game.
