================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The tkinter package is used for GUI development. It does not provide secure encryption or decryption capabilities and should not be used for storing or transmitting sensitive data.
Solution: For secure encryption or decryption, consider using a dedicated cryptography library, such as PyCrypto or cryptography.io, which offer advanced encryption algorithms and secure key management.

Vulnerability: CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: The random module is used for generating random numbers. If used for generating security tokens or session IDs, it can lead to predictable results, which is a security risk.
Solution: For generating secure random numbers, consider using the secrets module (Python 3.6+) or os.urandom() function, which are specifically designed for cryptographic use cases and provide better randomness.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Insecure Communication
Issue: There is no indication of secure communication between the application and any external systems or services.
Solution: Implement secure communication using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt data in transit. For Python, use the ssl module to enable SSL/TLS communication with external services.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The provided code does not appear to validate input data, which can lead to potential security issues like SQL injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
Solution: Validate all input data to ensure it is in the expected format and within acceptable length limits. Use parameterized queries, prepared statements, or escape special characters to prevent SQL injection attacks. Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful direction change from left to right
Details:
  TestName: test_change_direction_left_to_right
  Description: Verify that the direction changes successfully from left to right.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the initial direction to 'left'.
  Act: Call change_direction('right').
  Assert: Assert that the direction is changed to 'right'.
Validation:
  Changing the direction from left to right is a common use case in the snake game, and the test confirms the correct behavior of the change_direction function.

Scenario 2: Failed direction change from right to left
Details:
  TestName: test_change_direction_right_to_left
  Description: Verify that the direction does not change from right to left.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the initial direction to 'right'.
  Act: Call change_direction('left').
  Assert: Assert that the direction remains 'right'.
Validation:
  This test helps ensure that the game logic adheres to the requirement that the snake cannot reverse its direction.

Scenario 3: Successful direction change from up to down
Details:
  TestName: test_change_direction_up_to_down
  Description: Verify that the direction changes successfully from up to down.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the initial direction to 'up'.
  Act: Call change_direction('down').
  Assert: Assert that the direction is changed to 'down'.
Validation:
  Changing the direction from up to down is a common use case in the snake game, and the test confirms the correct behavior of the change_direction function.

Scenario 4: Failed direction change from down to up
Details:
  TestName: test_change_direction_down_to_up
  Description: Verify that the direction does not change from down to up.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the initial direction to 'down'.
  Act: Call change_direction('up').
  Assert: Assert that the direction remains 'down'.
Validation:
  This test helps ensure that the game logic adheres to the requirement that the snake cannot reverse its direction.

Scenario 5: Invalid direction input
Details:
  TestName: test_change_direction_invalid_input
  Description: Verify that the function handles invalid direction input gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the initial direction to any valid value.
  Act: Call change_direction('invalid_direction').
  Assert: Assert that the direction remains unchanged.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function does not crash or alter the game state when provided with an invalid input.

Scenario 6: Null direction input
Details:
  TestName: test_change_direction_null_input
  Description: Verify that the function handles a null direction input gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the initial direction to any valid value.
  Act: Call change_direction(None).
  Assert: Assert that the direction remains unchanged.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function does not crash or alter the game state when provided with a null input.

Scenario 7: Empty string direction input
Details:
  TestName: test_change_direction_empty_string_input
  Description: Verify that the function handles an empty string direction input gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the initial direction to any valid value.
  Act: Call change_direction('').
  Assert: Assert that the direction remains unchanged.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function does not crash or alter the game state when provided with an empty string input.

Scenario 8: Direction change when the current direction is the same as the new direction
Details:
  TestName: test_change_direction_same_direction
  Description: Verify that the direction does not change when the current direction and the new direction are the same.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the initial direction to any valid value.
  Act: Call change_direction('current_direction').
  Assert: Assert that the direction remains unchanged.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function does not alter the game state when the current direction and the new direction are the same.
