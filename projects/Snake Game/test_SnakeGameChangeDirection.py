================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: global variable
Issue: global variables can be modified from any scope, making the code prone to unintended changes and hard to debug
Solution: use local variables or class attributes instead of global variables

Vulnerability: import *
Issue: importing all modules from tkinter can lead to namespace pollution and potential conflicts with other modules
Solution: import only the necessary modules or functions from tkinter

Vulnerability: lacking input validation
Issue: the change_direction function does not validate the input, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors
Solution: add input validation to ensure the new_direction argument is one of the expected values

================================================================================
Here are the pytest test scenarios for the `snake_game.change_direction` method:

**Scenario 1: Change direction to left when current direction is up**
Details:
  TestName: test_change_direction_left_from_up
  Description: Verify that the direction can be changed to left when the current direction is up.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `direction` to 'up'.
  Act: Call `change_direction` with 'left' as the argument.
  Assert: Check that `direction` is now 'left'.
Validation: This test ensures that the function correctly changes the direction when the new direction is not opposite to the current direction.

**Scenario 2: Change direction to right when current direction is down**
Details:
  TestName: test_change_direction_right_from_down
  Description: Verify that the direction can be changed to right when the current direction is down.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `direction` to 'down'.
  Act: Call `change_direction` with 'right' as the argument.
  Assert: Check that `direction` is now 'right'.
Validation: This test ensures that the function correctly changes the direction when the new direction is not opposite to the current direction.

**Scenario 3: Cannot change direction to right when current direction is left**
Details:
  TestName: test_cannot_change_direction_right_from_left
  Description: Verify that the direction cannot be changed to right when the current direction is left.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `direction` to 'left'.
  Act: Call `change_direction` with 'right' as the argument.
  Assert: Check that `direction` is still 'left'.
Validation: This test ensures that the function correctly prevents changing the direction to the opposite direction.

**Scenario 4: Cannot change direction to left when current direction is right**
Details:
  TestName: test_cannot_change_direction_left_from_right
  Description: Verify that the direction cannot be changed to left when the current direction is right.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `direction` to 'right'.
  Act: Call `change_direction` with 'left' as the argument.
  Assert: Check that `direction` is still 'right'.
Validation: This test ensures that the function correctly prevents changing the direction to the opposite direction.

**Scenario 5: Cannot change direction to up when current direction is down**
Details:
  TestName: test_cannot_change_direction_up_from_down
  Description: Verify that the direction cannot be changed to up when the current direction is down.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `direction` to 'down'.
  Act: Call `change_direction` with 'up' as the argument.
  Assert: Check that `direction` is still 'down'.
Validation: This test ensures that the function correctly prevents changing the direction to the opposite direction.

**Scenario 6: Cannot change direction to down when current direction is up**
Details:
  TestName: test_cannot_change_direction_down_from_up
  Description: Verify that the direction cannot be changed to down when the current direction is up.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `direction` to 'up'.
  Act: Call `change_direction` with 'down' as the argument.
  Assert: Check that `direction` is still 'up'.
Validation: This test ensures that the function correctly prevents changing the direction to the opposite direction.

These scenarios cover the expected behavior, edge cases, and error conditions of the `snake_game.change_direction` method.
