================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The tkinter package is imported but not used in the code snippet. This package is not recommended for cryptographic operations due to its lack of cryptographic-grade randomness and potential vulnerabilities in its implementation.
Solution: Remove the unused import of the tkinter package to avoid potential security risks.

Vulnerability: CWE-602: Uncontrolled Interaction with Untrusted Third-Party Libraries or Frameworks
Issue: The random module is imported from python standard library but it is not recommended for cryptographic operations. It may not provide sufficient randomness for security-related use cases.
Solution: Replace the import of the random module with the 'secrets' module, which is specifically designed for generating cryptographically strong random numbers.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Change direction to left
Details:
  TestName: test_change_direction_to_left
  Description: Verify that the direction changes to left when the current direction is not right.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the initial direction to 'up'.
  Act: Call change_direction with 'left' as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the direction is now 'left'.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the snake can change its direction to left under the correct conditions, following the business logic.

Scenario 2: Fail to change direction to left from right
Details:
  TestName: test_change_direction_to_left_from_right
  Description: Verify that the direction does not change to left when the current direction is right.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the initial direction to 'right'.
  Act: Call change_direction with 'left' as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the direction remains 'right'.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the snake cannot change its direction to left when it is currently moving right, as it would cause the snake to collide with itself.

Scenario 3: Change direction to right
Details:
  TestName: test_change_direction_to_right
  Description: Verify that the direction changes to right when the current direction is not left.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the initial direction to 'up'.
  Act: Call change_direction with 'right' as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the direction is now 'right'.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the snake can change its direction to right under the correct conditions, following the business logic.

Scenario 4: Fail to change direction to right from left
Details:
  TestName: test_change_direction_to_right_from_left
  Description: Verify that the direction does not change to right when the current direction is left.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the initial direction to 'left'.
  Act: Call change_direction with 'right' as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the direction remains 'left'.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the snake cannot change its direction to right when it is currently moving left, as it would cause the snake to collide with itself.

Scenario 5: Change direction to up
Details:
  TestName: test_change_direction_to_up
  Description: Verify that the direction changes to up when the current direction is not down.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the initial direction to 'left'.
  Act: Call change_direction with 'up' as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the direction is now 'up'.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the snake can change its direction to up under the correct conditions, following the business logic.

Scenario 6: Fail to change direction to up from down
Details:
  TestName: test_change_direction_to_up_from_down
  Description: Verify that the direction does not change to up when the current direction is down.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the initial direction to 'down'.
  Act: Call change_direction with 'up' as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the direction remains 'down'.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the snake cannot change its direction to up when it is currently moving down, as it would cause the snake to collide with itself.

Scenario 7: Change direction to down
Details:
  TestName: test_change_direction_to_down
  Description: Verify that the direction changes to down when the current direction is not up.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the initial direction to 'left'.
  Act: Call change_direction with 'down' as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the direction is now 'down'.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the snake can change its direction to down under the correct conditions, following the business logic.

Scenario 8: Fail to change direction to down from up
Details:
  TestName: test_change_direction_to_down_from_up
  Description: Verify that the direction does not change to down when the current direction is up.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the initial direction to 'up'.
  Act: Call change_direction with 'down' as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the direction remains 'up'.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the snake cannot change its direction to down when it is currently moving up, as it would cause the snake to collide with itself.
