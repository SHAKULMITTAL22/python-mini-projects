Sure, here are some test scenarios for the `check_collisions` function:

1. Test with a snake that is completely within the game area.

```python
snake = Mock()
snake.coordinates = [(5, 5), (6, 6), (7, 7)]
GAME_WIDTH = 10
GAME_HEIGHT = 10
assert not check_collisions(snake)
```

2. Test with a snake that is partially outside the game area (left edge).

```python
snake = Mock()
snake.coordinates = [(-1, 5), (0, 5), (1, 5)]
GAME_WIDTH = 10
GAME_HEIGHT = 10
assert check_collisions(snake)
```

3. Test with a snake that is partially outside the game area (right edge).

```python
snake = Mock()
snake.coordinates = [(10, 5), (11, 5), (12, 5)]
GAME_WIDTH = 10
GAME_HEIGHT = 10
assert check_collisions(snake)
```

4. Test with a snake that is partially outside the game area (top edge).

```python
snake = Mock()
snake.coordinates = [(5, -1), (5, 0), (5, 1)]
GAME_WIDTH = 10
GAME_HEIGHT = 10
assert check_collisions(snake)
```

5. Test with a snake that is partially outside the game area (bottom edge).

```python
snake = Mock()
snake.coordinates = [(5, 10), (5, 11), (5, 12)]
GAME_WIDTH = 10
GAME_HEIGHT = 10
assert check_collisions(snake)
```

6. Test with a snake that has a body part at the same position as the head.

```python
snake = Mock()
snake.coordinates = [(5, 5), (5, 5), (6, 6)]
GAME_WIDTH = 10
GAME_HEIGHT = 10
assert check_collisions(snake)
```

Please note that the `Mock` object is used here to simulate the `snake` object. The `snake.coordinates` attribute is a list of tuples representing the coordinates of the snake's body parts. The `GAME_WIDTH` and `GAME_HEIGHT` are set to simulate the game area.
