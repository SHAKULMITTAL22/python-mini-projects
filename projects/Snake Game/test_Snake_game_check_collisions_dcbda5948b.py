Sure, here are some test scenarios for the `check_collisions` function:

1. Test with a snake that is completely within the game area.

```python
snake = Mock()
snake.coordinates = [(5, 5), (6, 6), (7, 7)]
GAME_WIDTH = 10
GAME_HEIGHT = 10
assert not check_collisions(snake)
```

2. Test with a snake that is partially outside the game area (left edge).

```python
snake = Mock()
snake.coordinates = [(-1, 5), (0, 5), (1, 5)]
GAME_WIDTH = 10
GAME_HEIGHT = 10
assert check_collisions(snake)
```

3. Test with a snake that is partially outside the game area (right edge).

```python
snake = Mock()
snake.coordinates = [(10, 5), (11, 5), (12, 5)]
GAME_WIDTH = 10
GAME_HEIGHT = 10
assert check_collisions(snake)
```

4. Test with a snake that is partially outside the game area (top edge).

```python
snake = Mock()
snake.coordinates = [(5, -1), (5, 0), (5, 1)]
GAME_WIDTH = 10
GAME_HEIGHT = 10
assert check_collisions(snake)
```

5. Test with a snake that is partially outside the game area (bottom edge).

```python
snake = Mock()
snake.coordinates = [(5, 10), (5, 11), (5, 12)]
GAME_WIDTH = 10
GAME_HEIGHT = 10
assert check_collisions(snake)
```

6. Test with a snake that has a body part at the same position as the head.

```python
snake = Mock()
snake.coordinates = [(5, 5), (5, 5), (6, 6)]
GAME_WIDTH = 10
GAME_HEIGHT = 10
assert check_collisions(snake)
```

Please note that I used `Mock()` to create a mock object for the `snake` parameter. This is a common way to create mock objects in Python's `unittest.mock` module.

Sure, here is a pytest for the `check_collisions` function:

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock
from snake_game import check_collisions, GAME_WIDTH, GAME_HEIGHT

def test_check_collisions_within_game_area():
    snake = Mock()
    snake.coordinates = [(5, 5), (6, 6), (7, 7)]
    assert not check_collisions(snake)

def test_check_collisions_left_edge():
    snake = Mock()
    snake.coordinates = [(-1, 5), (0, 5), (1, 5)]
    assert check_collisions(snake)

def test_check_collisions_right_edge():
    snake = Mock()
    snake.coordinates = [(GAME_WIDTH, 5), (GAME_WIDTH + 1, 5), (GAME_WIDTH + 2, 5)]
    assert check_collisions(snake)

def test_check_collisions_top_edge():
    snake = Mock()
    snake.coordinates = [(5, -1), (5, 0), (5, 1)]
    assert check_collisions(snake)

def test_check_collisions_bottom_edge():
    snake = Mock()
    snake.coordinates = [(5, GAME_HEIGHT), (5, GAME_HEIGHT + 1), (5, GAME_HEIGHT + 2)]
    assert check_collisions(snake)

def test_check_collisions_self_collision():
    snake = Mock()
    snake.coordinates = [(5, 5), (5, 5), (6, 6)]
    assert check_collisions(snake)
```

Please note that I used `GAME_WIDTH` and `GAME_HEIGHT` directly in the test for the right and bottom edge cases. This is because the `check_collisions` function uses these global variables to determine the game area boundaries. If these variables are changed in the main program, the tests will fail unless the tests are also updated to reflect this change.
