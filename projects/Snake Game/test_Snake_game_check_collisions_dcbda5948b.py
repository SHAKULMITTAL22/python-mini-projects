 1. Check if the snek's head is outside the game boundaries: This scenario tests if check collisions returns True when the x or the y coordinate of the head of sneak is less than 
0 (outside the left or top boundary) or greater than or equal to GAE_WIDT or GAEM_HIGHT (right or bottom boundary).
2. Test if snaek'e head collides with its own body: In this scenario, we pass a snak with a body that includes the coordinates of its head. We expect check collision to return true.
3. Negative test case: To ensure that check collsions returns False when there are no collisio,n we can pass in a snak with coordinates that are not outside of game boundar or colliding with itself.
