================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Issue: The use of hard-coded credentials, such as API keys or database passwords, can lead to unauthorized access if the code is compromised.
Solution: Remove or replace hard-coded credentials with a secure method such as environment variables, secure storage, or user input.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Insecure Transport Layer Protocol
Issue: The use of the tkinter library, which is not designed for secure communication, can lead to the interception of sensitive data.
Solution: Use a secure communication library, such as SSL or TLS, to encrypt sensitive data during transmission.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The lack of input validation in the random.randint() function can lead to integer overflow or underflow, resulting in unpredictable behavior or a denial of service.
Solution: Validate all inputs, including those from trusted sources, to ensure they are within acceptable boundaries and handle any errors gracefully.

Vulnerability: CWE-732: Insecure Communication
Issue: The use of the create_oval() function, which does not encrypt its output, can lead to the disclosure of sensitive data.
Solution: Use a secure communication library, such as SSL or TLS, to encrypt sensitive data during transmission.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test the initialization of food coordinates within the game boundaries
TestName: test_food_coordinates_initialization
Description: This test checks if the food coordinates are initialized within the game's boundaries, ensuring proper placement during the game.
Execution:
Arrange: No specific setup is required.
Act: Initialize the Food object.
Assert: Verify that the food coordinates are within the game boundaries by checking if the x and y values are between 0 and the calculated maximum value for each dimension.
Validation: It is crucial to validate that the food is placed within the game area to maintain a functional and enjoyable user experience.

Scenario 2: Test the randomization of food coordinates
TestName: test_food_coordinates_randomization
Description: This test verifies that the food coordinates are randomly generated within the game boundaries.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize multiple Food objects in a loop.
Act: None.
Assert: Check that the coordinates of the food objects are unique, demonstrating randomization.
Validation: Randomization of food coordinates ensures that the game remains challenging and engaging for the user.

Scenario 3: Test the creation of the food oval on the canvas
TestName: test_food_creation_on_canvas
Description: This test verifies that a food oval is created on the canvas with the correct position, dimensions, and color.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Food object.
Act: None.
Assert: Verify that the "food" object exists on the canvas with the correct position, dimensions, and color.
Validation: Ensuring that the food oval is created correctly is essential for the game's visual integrity and functionality.

Scenario 4: Test the SPACE_SIZE variable influence on food coordinates
TestName: test_food_coordinates_space_size_influence
Description: This test checks if the food coordinates are correctly calculated based on the SPACE_SIZE variable.
Execution:
Arrange: Set a custom SPACE_SIZE value.
Act: Initialize the Food object.
Assert: Verify that the food coordinates are calculated correctly based on the custom SPACE_SIZE value.
Validation: This test ensures that the food placement logic adapts to changes in the SPACE_SIZE variable, maintaining proper game functionality.

Scenario 5: Test the GAME_WIDTH and GAME_HEIGHT variables influence on food coordinates
TestName: test_food_coordinates_game_dimensions_influence
Description: This test checks if the food coordinates are correctly calculated based on the GAME_WIDTH and GAME_HEIGHT variables.
Execution:
Arrange: Set custom GAME_WIDTH and GAME_HEIGHT values.
Act: Initialize the Food object.
Assert: Verify that the food coordinates are calculated correctly based on the custom GAME_WIDTH and GAME_HEIGHT values.
Validation: This test ensures that the food placement logic adapts to changes in the game dimensions, maintaining proper game functionality.
