================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Information Exposure Through an Exception
Issue: The 'random.randint' function may raise a ValueError when given invalid input, potentially revealing sensitive information or aiding in a denial-of-service attack.
Solution: Ensure that the input to 'random.randint' is correctly validated. Enclose the instantiation of the 'random' module in a try-except block to handle the ValueError exception.

Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Issue: The 'create_oval' function in the 'tkinter' module may not properly sanitize input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
Solution: Sanitize all user-supplied input before passing it to the 'create_oval' function to prevent XSS attacks.

================================================================================
1. Scenario: Food coordinates are initialized within the game boundaries
Details:
TestName: test_food_initialization_within_game_boundaries
Description: The food object's coordinates should be initialized within the game's boundaries, ensuring it appears inside the playable area.
Execution:
Arrange: No specific setup required.
Act: Call the `snake_game.Food.__init__` method.
Assert: Verify that the `x` and `y` coordinates of the food object fall within the game's boundaries, accounting for the `SPACE_SIZE`.
Validation: This test validates that the food object is always visible and accessible to the player within the game area.

2. Scenario: Food coordinates are integers
Details:
TestName: test_food_coordinates_are_integers
Description: The food object's coordinates should be integers, as they represent pixel positions on the canvas.
Execution:
Arrange: No specific setup required.
Act: Call the `snake_game.Food.__init__` method.
Assert: Verify that the `x` and `y` coordinates of the food object are integers.
Validation: This test ensures that the food object is positioned correctly on the canvas, avoiding floating-point precision issues.

3. Scenario: Food coordinates are generated randomly
Details:
TestName: test_food_coordinates_are_randomly_generated
Description: The food object's coordinates should be generated randomly within the game's boundaries.
Execution:
Arrange: No specific setup required.
Act: Call the `snake_game.Food.__init__` method multiple times.
Assert: Verify that the `x` and `y` coordinates of the food object are different for each instance.
Validation: This test validates that the food object appears at different positions in the game area, encouraging players to explore the game space.

4. Scenario: Food is displayed on the canvas
Details:
TestName: test_food_display_on_canvas
Description: The food object should be displayed on the game's canvas as a filled oval.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the `canvas` object.
Act: Call the `snake_game.Food.__init__` method.
Assert: Verify that a filled oval is created on the canvas with the specified `FOOD_COLOR` and tag "food".
Validation: This test ensures that the food object is visible to the player, allowing them to interact with it during the game.

5. Scenario: Food coordinates are rounded to the nearest SPACE_SIZE
Details:
TestName: test_food_coordinates_are_rounded_to_space_size
Description: The food object's coordinates should be rounded to the nearest `SPACE_SIZE` value to ensure the oval is aligned with the game's grid.
Execution:
Arrange: No specific setup required.
Act: Call the `snake_game.Food.__init__` method.
Assert: Verify that the `x` and `y` coordinates of the food object are multiples of `SPACE_SIZE`.
Validation: This test ensures that the food object is aligned with the game's grid, providing a consistent and visually appealing experience.
