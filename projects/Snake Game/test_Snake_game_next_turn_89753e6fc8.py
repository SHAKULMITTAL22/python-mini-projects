================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper use of global variables
Issue: The global keyword is used for the 'score' variable, which can lead to unintended side-effects if not handled carefully. It's generally a bad practice to use global variables.
Solution: It would be better to encapsulate the 'score' within a class or pass it as an argument to the function.

Vulnerability: Improper Error Handling
Issue: The code does not contain any exception handling. This could lead to crashes or unexpected behavior when an error occurs.
Solution: Surround parts of the code that could potentially raise exceptions with try/except blocks. This will allow you to handle errors gracefully and prevent the entire program from crashing if an error occurs.

Vulnerability: Unvalidated User Input
Issue: The direction of the snake seems to be controlled by some user input, but there's no validation for it in the code. This could lead to unexpected behavior.
Solution: Always validate user inputs. For direction, make sure it's one of the four valid directions before proceeding with the game logic.

1. Scenario: Check if the snake moves up when the direction is set to "up".
   Expected Outcome: The snake's y-coordinate should decrease by the SPACE_SIZE.

2. Scenario: Check if the snake moves down when the direction is set to "down".
   Expected Outcome: The snake's y-coordinate should increase by the SPACE_SIZE.

3. Scenario: Check if the snake moves left when the direction is set to "left".
   Expected Outcome: The snake's x-coordinate should decrease by the SPACE_SIZE.

4. Scenario: Check if the snake moves right when the direction is set to "right".
   Expected Outcome: The snake's x-coordinate should increase by the SPACE_SIZE.

5. Scenario: Check if the snake's new coordinates are inserted at the beginning of the coordinates list.
   Expected Outcome: The new coordinates should be the first item in the snake's coordinates list.

6. Scenario: Check if a new square is created and inserted at the beginning of the snake's squares list.
   Expected Outcome: The new square should be the first item in the snake's squares list.

7. Scenario: Check if the score increases when the snake's coordinates match the food's coordinates.
   Expected Outcome: The score should increase by 1.

8. Scenario: Check if the food is deleted and a new food is created when the snake's coordinates match the food's coordinates.
   Expected Outcome: The old food should be deleted and a new food should be created.

9. Scenario: Check if the last coordinates and square of the snake are deleted when the snake's coordinates do not match the food's coordinates.
   Expected Outcome: The last item in the snake's coordinates and squares list should be deleted.

10. Scenario: Check if the game ends when the check_collisions function returns True.
    Expected Outcome: The game_over function should be called.

11. Scenario: Check if the next_turn function is called again after a delay when the check_collisions function returns False.
    Expected Outcome: The next_turn function should be called again after a delay specified by SPEED.
