================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: The use of tkinter library can potentially lead to code execution vulnerabilities if not properly sanitized. Although this specific code does not suffer from this issue, it's important to note for future development.
Solution: Ensure that all inputs passed to tkinter functions are sanitized and validated. Avoid using functions that can execute arbitrary commands or code.

Vulnerability: CWE-488: Exposure of Data Element to Wrong Session
Issue: The global keyword is used to modify the 'score' variable, which can potentially lead to data leakage or corruption if multiple sessions are running concurrently.
Solution: Avoid using the global keyword. Consider using class or instance variables instead to encapsulate data.

Vulnerability: CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')
Issue: The snake coordinates are directly manipulated without any bounds checking. This can potentially lead to buffer overflow if the snake's coordinates exceed the expected limits.
Solution: Always validate and check the bounds of an array before inserting or removing elements. Consider using a data structure that automatically handles bounds checking.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The direction of the snake is not validated before it's used to calculate the next turn. This can potentially lead to unexpected behavior if an invalid direction is provided.
Solution: Always validate inputs before using them. In this case, ensure that the provided direction is one of the expected values (up, down, left, right) before using it.

================================================================================
1. Scenario: Snake moves up
   Given a snake object with a certain coordinate and a direction set to "up", when next_turn is called, the snake should move up by SPACE_SIZE. The new coordinate should be inserted at the start of the snake's coordinates list.

2. Scenario: Snake moves down
   Given a snake object with a certain coordinate and a direction set to "down", when next_turn is called, the snake should move down by SPACE_SIZE. The new coordinate should be inserted at the start of the snake's coordinates list.

3. Scenario: Snake moves left
   Given a snake object with a certain coordinate and a direction set to "left", when next_turn is called, the snake should move left by SPACE_SIZE. The new coordinate should be inserted at the start of the snake's coordinates list.

4. Scenario: Snake moves right
   Given a snake object with a certain coordinate and a direction set to "right", when next_turn is called, the snake should move right by SPACE_SIZE. The new coordinate should be inserted at the start of the snake's coordinates list.

5. Scenario: Snake eats food
   Given a snake object and a food object with matching coordinates, when next_turn is called, the score should increase by 1, the food object should be deleted and a new food object should be created.

6. Scenario: Snake does not eat food
   Given a snake object and a food object with different coordinates, when next_turn is called, the last coordinate of the snake should be deleted from the coordinates list and the corresponding square should also be deleted.

7. Scenario: Snake collides with itself or wall
   Given a snake object, when next_turn is called and check_collisions returns True, the game should end.

8. Scenario: Snake does not collide with itself or wall
   Given a snake object, when next_turn is called and check_collisions returns False, the next_turn function should be called again after a delay determined by the SPEED constant.
