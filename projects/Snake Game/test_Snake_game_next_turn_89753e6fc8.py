Based on the provided code snippet, it seems like the function `next_turn` is a part of a snake game. The function takes two parameters: `snake` and `food`. The `snake` parameter is an object that contains information about the snake, including its coordinates and the squares it occupies on the game board. The `food` parameter is an object that represents the food in the game.

The function seems to be updating the state of the game based on the current direction of the snake and the position of the food. If the snake eats the food, the score is increased and a new piece of food is placed. If the snake collides with itself or the edge of the game board, the game is over.

Here are some test scenarios that you can use to validate the business logic of this function:

1. **Test with a snake that moves up**: Check if the y-coordinate of the snake's head decreases by `SPACE_SIZE` when the direction is "up".

2. **Test with a snake that moves down**: Check if the y-coordinate of the snake's head increases by `SPACE_SIZE` when the direction is "down".

3. **Test with a snake that moves left**: Check if the x-coordinate of the snake's head decreases by `SPACE_SIZE` when the direction is "left".

4. **Test with a snake that moves right**: Check if the x-coordinate of the snake's head increases by `SPACE_SIZE` when the direction is "right".

5. **Test with a snake that eats food**: Check if the score increases by 1 when the snake's head coordinates match the food's coordinates. Also, check if a new piece of food is created.

6. **Test with a snake that collides with itself or the edge of the game board**: Check if the game_over function is called when the snake collides with itself or the edge of the game board.

7. **Test with a snake that moves without eating food**: Check if the snake's tail is removed when the snake does not eat food.

Remember to mock the `snake`, `food`, `canvas`, `window`, `score`, `label`, `SPEED`, `SNAKE_COLOR`, `SPACE_SIZE`, `check_collisions`, and `game_over` functions to ensure they are working correctly.

# ********RoostGPT********
Sure, here is a pytest for the `next_turn` function. I've mocked the `snake`, `food`, `canvas`, `window`, `score`, `label`, `SPEED`, `SNAKE_COLOR`, `SPACE_SIZE`, `check_collisions`, and `game_over` functions.

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
from tkinter import *
import random

GAME_WIDTH = 700
GAME_HEIGHT = 700
SPEED = 100
SPACE_SIZE = 50
BODY_PARTS = 3
SNAKE_COLOR = '#00FF00'
FOOD_COLOR = '#FF0000'
BACKGROUND_COLOR = '#000000'

class Snake:
    def __init__(self):
        self.coordinates = [(0, 0)]
        self.squares = [canvas.create_rectangle(0, 0, SPACE_SIZE, SPACE_SIZE, fill=SNAKE_COLOR)]

class Food:
    def __init__(self):
        self.coordinates = [(0, 0)]

def check_collisions(snake):
    return False

def game_over():
    pass

@patch('snake_game.check_collisions', return_value=False)
@patch('snake_game.game_over')
@patch('snake_game.Food')
@patch('snake_game.Snake')
def test_next_turn(MockSnake, MockFood, MockGameOver, MockCheckCollisions):
    snake = MockSnake()
    food = MockFood()
    window = Tk()
    canvas = Canvas(window, bg=BACKGROUND_COLOR, height=GAME_HEIGHT, width=GAME_WIDTH)
    score = 0
    label = Label(window, text='Score:{}'.format(score), font=('consolas', 40))
    direction = 'down'

    # Test with a snake that moves down
    direction = 'down'
    next_turn(snake, food)
    assert snake.coordinates[0][1] == SPACE_SIZE

    # Test with a snake that moves up
    direction = 'up'
    next_turn(snake, food)
    assert snake.coordinates[0][1] == 0

    # Test with a snake that moves left
    direction = 'left'
    next_turn(snake, food)
    assert snake.coordinates[0][0] == 0

    # Test with a snake that moves right
    direction = 'right'
    next_turn(snake, food)
    assert snake.coordinates[0][0] == SPACE_SIZE

    # Test with a snake that eats food
    snake.coordinates[0] = food.coordinates
    next_turn(snake, food)
    assert score == 1
    assert MockFood.call_count == 1

    # Test with a snake that collides with itself or the edge of the game board
    MockCheckCollisions.return_value = True
    next_turn(snake, food)
    assert MockGameOver.call_count == 1

    # Test with a snake that moves without eating food
    direction = 'down'
    next_turn(snake, food)
    assert len(snake.coordinates) == BODY_PARTS
```

This test suite covers all the test scenarios you mentioned. It tests the `next_turn` function with different directions and checks if the snake's coordinates and score are updated correctly. It also tests the case where the snake eats food and a new piece of food is created. Finally, it tests the case where the snake collides with itself or the edge of the game board, and verifies that the `game_over` function is called.
