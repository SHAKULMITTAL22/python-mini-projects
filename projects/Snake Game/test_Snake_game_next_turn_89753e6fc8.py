================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Format String (CWE-134)
Issue: The use of the .format() function in the label.config(text="Score:{}".format(score)) line can potentially lead to format string attacks if the 'score' variable is not properly sanitized or is controlled by an attacker.
Solution: Ensure that the 'score' variable is properly sanitized and not controllable by an attacker. Alternatively, use f-strings or string concatenation which are safer as they do not support format specifiers.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) (CWE-639)
Issue: The code directly references objects such as 'snake' and 'food' without any access control checks. If an attacker can predict or control these references, they can manipulate the game state.
Solution: Implement access control checks or indirect object references to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of game objects.

Vulnerability: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') (CWE-79)
Issue: The code does not sanitize or escape the 'score' variable before it is displayed on the label. If an attacker can control the 'score' variable, they could potentially execute arbitrary code in the context of the game.
Solution: Sanitize and escape all user-controllable variables before they are displayed on the UI. Use secure coding libraries or frameworks that automatically provide this functionality.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test when the snake moves up
Details:
  TestName: test_next_turn_move_up
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the snake's coordinates are correctly updated when the direction is "up".
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a snake object with a certain coordinate and set the direction to "up".
  Act: Invoke the next_turn function with the snake and a food object.
  Assert: Check if the y-coordinate of the snake's head has decreased by SPACE_SIZE.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the snake moves correctly in the upward direction.

Scenario 2: Test when the snake eats the food
Details:
  TestName: test_next_turn_eat_food
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the score is incremented and a new food object is created when the snake's head is at the same coordinates as the food.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a snake object and a food object with the same coordinates.
  Act: Invoke the next_turn function with the snake and the food object.
  Assert: Check if the score has increased by 1 and a new food object is created.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the game correctly handles the scenario when the snake eats the food.

Scenario 3: Test when the snake does not eat the food
Details:
  TestName: test_next_turn_not_eat_food
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the last coordinate and square of the snake are removed when the snake does not eat the food.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a snake object and a food object with different coordinates.
  Act: Invoke the next_turn function with the snake and the food object.
  Assert: Check if the last coordinate and square of the snake are removed.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the game correctly handles the scenario when the snake does not eat the food.

Scenario 4: Test when the snake collides
Details:
  TestName: test_next_turn_collision
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the game is over when the snake collides.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a snake object in a state that will cause a collision.
  Act: Invoke the next_turn function with the snake and a food object.
  Assert: Check if the game is over.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the game correctly handles the scenario when the snake collides.

Scenario 5: Test when the snake moves right
Details:
  TestName: test_next_turn_move_right
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the snake's coordinates are correctly updated when the direction is "right".
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a snake object with a certain coordinate and set the direction to "right".
  Act: Invoke the next_turn function with the snake and a food object.
  Assert: Check if the x-coordinate of the snake's head has increased by SPACE_SIZE.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the snake moves correctly in the right direction.
