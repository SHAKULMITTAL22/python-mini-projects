Based on the provided code snippet, it seems like the function `next_turn` is a part of a snake game. The function takes two parameters: `snake` and `food`. The `snake` parameter is an object that contains information about the snake, including its coordinates and the squares it occupies on the canvas. The `food` parameter is an object that represents the food in the game.

The function seems to be updating the snake's position based on the current direction, and then checking if the snake has collided with the food or the walls of the game window. If the snake has collided with the food, the score is incremented and a new piece of food is generated. If the snake has collided with the walls or itself, the game is over.

Here are some test scenarios that you might consider:

1. Test with a snake that starts at the top left corner of the game window and moves right. The snake should move one space to the right and not hit the walls.

2. Test with a snake that starts at the top left corner and moves down. The snake should move one space down and not hit the walls.

3. Test with a snake that starts at the top left corner and moves left. The snake should move one space to the left and not hit the walls.

4. Test with a snake that starts at the top left corner and moves up. The snake should move one space up and not hit the walls.

5. Test with a snake that starts at the top left corner and moves right. If the snake eats the food, the score should increase by one and a new piece of food should be generated.

6. Test with a snake that starts at the top left corner and moves right. If the snake hits itself, the game should end.

7. Test with a snake that starts at the top left corner and moves right. If the snake hits a wall, the game should end.

Remember, these are just test scenarios. The actual input data or ranges would be provided when generating test code for this function.

Here is a pytest for the `next_turn` function. This test assumes that the `Snake` and `Food` classes have been defined and that the `change_direction` function is available.

def test_next_turn_hit_self(setup):

    assert game_over.called

def test_next_turn_hit_wall(setup):

    snake.coordinates = [(GAME_WIDTH - SPACE_SIZE, 0)]
    change_direction('right')
    next_turn(snake, food)
    assert game_over.called
```

This test suite includes a setup fixture that creates a new game window and snake/food objects for each test. The tests themselves call the `next_turn` function with the snake and food objects, and then assert that the snake's coordinates have changed as expected.

Please note that this is a basic test suite and does not cover all possible scenarios. You may need to add more tests to fully test the `next_turn` function.
