================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The Python code snippet does not contain any cryptographic operations, but it is crucial to mention that utilizing insecure algorithms or protocols can expose sensitive data and weaken system security. For instance, using outdated algorithms like SHA-1 or MD5 for hashing or storing passwords can be easily compromised.
Solution: Replace insecure algorithms with more robust and secure alternatives, like SHA-256 or SHA-3 for hashing. Employ a secure password hashing function, such as bcrypt or Argon2, to safeguard sensitive user data. Implement encryption using industry-standard libraries and protocols, such as those recommended by NIST.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The 'check_collisions' function does not validate input parameters, making it vulnerable to exceptional conditions and potential errors. This can lead to unintended behavior or even denial-of-service attacks.
Solution: Validate input parameters within the function by checking for data types, length, or any other relevant constraints. Handle exceptions gracefully by raising appropriate exceptions or returning meaningful error messages.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test collision detection when the snake's head goes beyond the game's width boundary
Details:
TestName: test_check_collisions_exceeds_game_width
Description: Verify that the function returns True when the snake's head moves outside the game's width boundary.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize a snake object with a head coordinate beyond the game's width boundary.
Act: Call the check_collisions function with the prepared snake object.
Assert: Assert that the function returns True.
Validation: Ensuring that the function correctly detects collisions when the snake's head goes beyond the game's width boundary is essential for maintaining a functional game state.

Scenario 2: Test collision detection when the snake's head goes beyond the game's height boundary
Details:
TestName: test_check_collisions_exceeds_game_height
Description: Verify that the function returns True when the snake's head moves outside the game's height boundary.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize a snake object with a head coordinate beyond the game's height boundary.
Act: Call the check_collisions function with the prepared snake object.
Assert: Assert that the function returns True.
Validation: Ensuring that the function correctly detects collisions when the snake's head goes beyond the game's height boundary is essential for maintaining a functional game state.

Scenario 3: Test collision detection when the snake's head collides with its body
Details:
TestName: test_check_collisions_head_collides_body
Description: Verify that the function returns True when the snake's head collides with its body.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize a snake object with a head coordinate that matches one of its body coordinates.
Act: Call the check_collisions function with the prepared snake object.
Assert: Assert that the function returns True.
Validation: Ensuring that the function correctly detects collisions when the snake's head collides with its body is essential for maintaining a functional game state.

Scenario 4: Test collision detection when the snake's head is within the game boundaries and doesn't collide with its body
Details:
TestName: test_check_collisions_no_collision
Description: Verify that the function returns False when the snake's head is within the game boundaries and doesn't collide with its body.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize a snake object with a head coordinate within the game boundaries and not colliding with its body.
Act: Call the check_collisions function with the prepared snake object.
Assert: Assert that the function returns False.
Validation: Ensuring that the function correctly identifies the absence of collisions is essential for maintaining smooth game functionality.

Scenario 5: Test collision detection when the snake's head is at the left boundary
Details:
TestName: test_check_collisions_at_left_boundary
Description: Verify that the function returns False when the snake's head is at the left boundary and doesn't collide with its body.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize a snake object with a head coordinate at the left boundary and not colliding with its body.
Act: Call the check_collisions function with the prepared snake object.
Assert: Assert that the function returns False.
Validation: Ensuring that the function correctly identifies the absence of collisions at the left boundary is essential for maintaining smooth game functionality.

Scenario 6: Test collision detection when the snake's head is at the right boundary
Details:
TestName: test_check_collisions_at_right_boundary
Description: Verify that the function returns False when the snake's head is at the right boundary and doesn't collide with its body.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize a snake object with a head coordinate at the right boundary and not colliding with its body.
Act: Call the check_collisions function with the prepared snake object.
Assert: Assert that the function returns False.
Validation: Ensuring that the function correctly identifies the absence of collisions at the right boundary is essential for maintaining smooth game functionality.

Scenario 7: Test collision detection when the snake's head is at the top boundary
Details:
TestName: test_check_collisions_at_top_boundary
Description: Verify that the function returns False when the snake's head is at the top boundary and doesn't collide with its body.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize a snake object with a head coordinate at the top boundary and not colliding with its body.
Act: Call the check_collisions function with the prepared snake object.
Assert: Assert that the function returns False.
Validation: Ensuring that the function correctly identifies the absence of collisions at the top boundary is essential for maintaining smooth game functionality.

Scenario 8: Test collision detection when the snake's head is at the bottom boundary
Details:
TestName: test_check_collisions_at_bottom_boundary
Description: Verify that the function returns False when the snake's head is at the bottom boundary and doesn't collide with its body.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize a snake object with a head coordinate at the bottom boundary and not colliding with its body.
Act: Call the check_collisions function with the prepared snake object.
Assert: Assert that the function returns False.
Validation: Ensuring that the function correctly identifies the absence of collisions at the bottom boundary is essential for maintaining smooth game functionality.
