================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not validate or sanitize the coordinates of the snake before checking for collisions. This could potentially allow for invalid or malicious input to cause unintended behavior or crashes.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure the coordinates are within valid ranges and of the expected data type before processing them in the check_collisions function.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: The code does not limit the size of the snake or the number of coordinates it can have. This could lead to excessive memory consumption if the snake grows too large, potentially causing resource exhaustion or denial of service.
Solution: Implement a maximum limit on the size of the snake or the number of coordinates it can store. Ensure that the snake's growth is properly managed and old coordinates are removed when no longer needed.

Vulnerability: CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable
Issue: The code assumes that the snake object has a coordinates attribute, but it does not explicitly initialize or check for its existence. If the snake object does not have a properly initialized coordinates attribute, it could lead to AttributeError exceptions or undefined behavior.
Solution: Ensure that the snake object is properly initialized with a coordinates attribute before calling the check_collisions function. Add appropriate error handling or default value assignment to handle cases where the coordinates attribute is missing or not properly initialized.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Snake collides with the left boundary of the game area
Details:
  TestName: test_check_collisions_left_boundary
  Description: This test verifies that the check_collisions function correctly detects when the snake's head collides with the left boundary of the game area.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a snake object with coordinates where the x-coordinate of the head is less than 0.
  Act: Call the check_collisions function with the snake object as the argument.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns True, indicating a collision.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the game correctly detects collisions with the left boundary of the game area. It verifies that the function properly checks the x-coordinate of the snake's head against the left boundary condition (x < 0).

Scenario 2: Snake collides with the right boundary of the game area
Details:
  TestName: test_check_collisions_right_boundary
  Description: This test verifies that the check_collisions function correctly detects when the snake's head collides with the right boundary of the game area.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a snake object with coordinates where the x-coordinate of the head is greater than or equal to GAME_WIDTH.
  Act: Call the check_collisions function with the snake object as the argument.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns True, indicating a collision.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the game correctly detects collisions with the right boundary of the game area. It verifies that the function properly checks the x-coordinate of the snake's head against the right boundary condition (x >= GAME_WIDTH).

Scenario 3: Snake collides with the top boundary of the game area
Details:
  TestName: test_check_collisions_top_boundary
  Description: This test verifies that the check_collisions function correctly detects when the snake's head collides with the top boundary of the game area.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a snake object with coordinates where the y-coordinate of the head is less than 0.
  Act: Call the check_collisions function with the snake object as the argument.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns True, indicating a collision.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the game correctly detects collisions with the top boundary of the game area. It verifies that the function properly checks the y-coordinate of the snake's head against the top boundary condition (y < 0).

Scenario 4: Snake collides with the bottom boundary of the game area
Details:
  TestName: test_check_collisions_bottom_boundary
  Description: This test verifies that the check_collisions function correctly detects when the snake's head collides with the bottom boundary of the game area.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a snake object with coordinates where the y-coordinate of the head is greater than or equal to GAME_HEIGHT.
  Act: Call the check_collisions function with the snake object as the argument.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns True, indicating a collision.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the game correctly detects collisions with the bottom boundary of the game area. It verifies that the function properly checks the y-coordinate of the snake's head against the bottom boundary condition (y >= GAME_HEIGHT).

Scenario 5: Snake collides with its own body
Details:
  TestName: test_check_collisions_self_collision
  Description: This test verifies that the check_collisions function correctly detects when the snake's head collides with any part of its own body.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a snake object with coordinates where the head's position matches a position of one of the body parts.
  Act: Call the check_collisions function with the snake object as the argument.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns True, indicating a collision.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the game correctly detects self-collisions. It verifies that the function properly checks the coordinates of the snake's head against each body part's coordinates to identify a collision.

Scenario 6: Snake does not collide with any boundaries or itself
Details:
  TestName: test_check_collisions_no_collision
  Description: This test verifies that the check_collisions function correctly detects when there are no collisions with boundaries or the snake's own body.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a snake object with coordinates where the head is within the game area and does not collide with any body parts.
  Act: Call the check_collisions function with the snake object as the argument.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns False, indicating no collision.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the game correctly identifies the absence of collisions when the snake is in a valid position within the game area and not colliding with itself. It verifies that the function properly checks all collision conditions and returns False when none of them are met.
