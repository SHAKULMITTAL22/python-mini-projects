================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: cwe-20
Issue: the function check_collisions() does not validate the input 'snake' which could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if 'snake' is not of the expected type or structure.
Solution: add input validation to the function to ensure 'snake' is of the expected type and structure. for example, use isinstance() to check the type of 'snake' and its attributes.

Vulnerability: cwe-113
Issue: the code uses the wildcard import 'from tkinter import *' which could lead to naming conflicts and unexpected behavior.
Solution: avoid using wildcard imports and instead import only the necessary modules or functions. for example, 'from tkinter import Tk, Label, Button'.

Vulnerability: cwe-252
Issue: the code does not follow secure coding practices for error handling. it does not catch or handle potential exceptions that could occur during execution.
Solution: add try-except blocks to catch and handle potential exceptions. for example, use try-except blocks to handle potential index errors when accessing 'snake.coordinates'.

================================================================================
Here are the pytest test scenarios for the `check_collisions` method:

**Scenario 1: Collision with wall (left)**
Details:
  TestName: `test_collision_with_wall_left`
  Description: Verify that the function returns `True` when the snake's head collides with the left wall.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `snake` object with its head at coordinates `(0, 10)`.
  Act: Call `check_collisions(snake)`.
  Assert: The function returns `True`.
Validation: This test ensures the function correctly detects collisions with the game boundaries, which is a critical aspect of the snake game's business logic.

**Scenario 2: Collision with wall (right)**
Details:
  TestName: `test_collision_with_wall_right`
  Description: Verify that the function returns `True` when the snake's head collides with the right wall.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `snake` object with its head at coordinates `(GAME_WIDTH, 10)`.
  Act: Call `check_collisions(snake)`.
  Assert: The function returns `True`.
Validation: This test ensures the function correctly detects collisions with the game boundaries, which is a critical aspect of the snake game's business logic.

**Scenario 3: Collision with wall (top)**
Details:
  TestName: `test_collision_with_wall_top`
  Description: Verify that the function returns `True` when the snake's head collides with the top wall.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `snake` object with its head at coordinates `(10, 0)`.
  Act: Call `check_collisions(snake)`.
  Assert: The function returns `True`.
Validation: This test ensures the function correctly detects collisions with the game boundaries, which is a critical aspect of the snake game's business logic.

**Scenario 4: Collision with wall (bottom)**
Details:
  TestName: `test_collision_with_wall_bottom`
  Description: Verify that the function returns `True` when the snake's head collides with the bottom wall.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `snake` object with its head at coordinates `(10, GAME_HEIGHT)`.
  Act: Call `check_collisions(snake)`.
  Assert: The function returns `True`.
Validation: This test ensures the function correctly detects collisions with the game boundaries, which is a critical aspect of the snake game's business logic.

**Scenario 5: No collision**
Details:
  TestName: `test_no_collision`
  Description: Verify that the function returns `False` when the snake's head does not collide with any wall or its own body.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `snake` object with its head at coordinates `(10, 10)`.
  Act: Call `check_collisions(snake)`.
  Assert: The function returns `False`.
Validation: This test ensures the function correctly returns `False` when there is no collision, which is essential for the game to continue.

**Scenario 6: Collision with snake body**
Details:
  TestName: `test_collision_with_snake_body`
  Description: Verify that the function returns `True` when the snake's head collides with its own body.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `snake` object with its head at coordinates `(10, 10)` and a body part at the same coordinates.
  Act: Call `check_collisions(snake)`.
  Assert: The function returns `True`.
Validation: This test ensures the function correctly detects self-collisions, which is a critical aspect of the snake game's business logic.

**Scenario 7: Edge case - snake head at origin**
Details:
  TestName: `test_edge_case_origin`
  Description: Verify that the function returns `False` when the snake's head is at the origin `(0, 0)`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `snake` object with its head at coordinates `(0, 0)`.
  Act: Call `check_collisions(snake)`.
  Assert: The function returns `False`.
Validation: This test ensures the function correctly handles edge cases, which is important for the game's stability.

These scenarios cover the expected behavior, edge cases, and error conditions of the `check_collisions` method, ensuring comprehensive testing of the business logic.
