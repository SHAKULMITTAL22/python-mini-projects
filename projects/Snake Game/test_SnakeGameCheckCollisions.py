================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function `check_collisions` does not validate the `snake` parameter, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or exceptions if an invalid value is passed.
Solution: Validate the `snake` parameter at the beginning of the function, raising a custom or built-in exception if the input is invalid.

Vulnerability: CWE-789: Uncontrolled Memory Allocation
Issue: The code imports the `random` module, which could potentially be used for uncontrolled memory allocation, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack if misused.
Solution: Use the `random` module sparingly and with caution, ensuring that any memory allocation is controlled and limited within acceptable bounds. Consider using `random.choices` or `random.sample` with `k` parameter to limit memory allocation.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The code uses the `tkinter` module, which is not a cryptographic library. However, it may be used in conjunction with cryptographic functions, potentially leading to insecure cryptographic implementations.
Solution: Ensure that any cryptographic operations are performed using well-established and secure cryptographic libraries, such as `cryptography` or `pycryptodome`. Avoid implementing custom cryptographic algorithms.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test if a collision is detected when the snake's head reaches the left border
Details:
TestName: test_head_collision_left_border
Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a collision when the snake's head reaches the left border of the game area.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize a snake object with a head coordinate at (0, 0) and a body coordinate at (1, 0).
Act: Call the check_collisions function with the snake object as the parameter.
Assert: Validate that the function returns True, indicating a collision.
Validation:
This test case is critical to ensure that the game terminates when the snake hits the left border, adhering to the game's specifications.

Scenario 2: Test if a collision is detected when the snake's head reaches the right border
Details:
TestName: test_head_collision_right_border
Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a collision when the snake's head reaches the right border of the game area.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize a snake object with a head coordinate at (GAME_WIDTH - 1, 0) and a body coordinate at (GAME_WIDTH - 2, 0).
Act: Call the check_collisions function with the snake object as the parameter.
Assert: Validate that the function returns True, indicating a collision.
Validation:
This test case is necessary to confirm that the game terminates when the snake hits the right border, following the game's specifications.

Scenario 3: Test if a collision is detected when the snake's head reaches the top border
Details:
TestName: test_head_collision_top_border
Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a collision when the snake's head reaches the top border of the game area.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize a snake object with a head coordinate at (0, 0) and a body coordinate at (0, 1).
Act: Call the check_collisions function with the snake object as the parameter.
Assert: Validate that the function returns True, indicating a collision.
Validation:
This test case is important to ensure that the game terminates when the snake hits the top border, complying with the game's specifications.

Scenario 4: Test if a collision is detected when the snake's head reaches the bottom border
Details:
TestName: test_head_collision_bottom_border
Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a collision when the snake's head reaches the bottom border of the game area.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize a snake object with a head coordinate at (0, GAME_HEIGHT - 1) and a body coordinate at (0, GAME_HEIGHT - 2).
Act: Call the check_collisions function with the snake object as the parameter.
Assert: Validate that the function returns True, indicating a collision.
Validation:
This test case is essential to confirm that the game terminates when the snake hits the bottom border, following the game's specifications.

Scenario 5: Test if a collision is detected when the snake's head collides with its body
Details:
TestName: test_head_collision_with_body
Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a collision when the snake's head collides with its body.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize a snake object with a head coordinate at (0, 0) and body coordinates at (1, 0), (2, 0), and (0, 1).
Act: Call the check_collisions function with the snake object as the parameter.
Assert: Validate that the function returns True, indicating a collision.
Validation:
This test case is crucial to ensure that the game terminates when the snake collides with itself, adhering to the game's rules.

Scenario 6: Test if no collision is detected when the snake's head is within the game area and not colliding with its body
Details:
TestName: test_no_collision
Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies that there is no collision when the snake's head is within the game area and not colliding with its body.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize a snake object with a head coordinate at (0, 0) and body coordinates at (1, 0), (2, 0), and (3, 0).
Act: Call the check_collisions function with the snake object as the parameter.
Assert: Validate that the function returns False, indicating no collision.
Validation:
This test case is necessary to ensure that the game continues as expected when there is no collision, complying with the game's rules.
