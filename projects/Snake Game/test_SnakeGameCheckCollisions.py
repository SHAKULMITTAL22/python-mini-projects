================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: insecure import
Issue: importing all modules from tkinter with * can lead to namespace pollution and potential security issues
Solution: import specific modules or classes from tkinter instead of importing everything, e.g., from tkinter import Tk, Label, Button

Vulnerability: undefined variables
Issue: GAME_WIDTH and GAME_HEIGHT are used but not defined, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors
Solution: define GAME_WIDTH and GAME_HEIGHT before using them, e.g., GAME_WIDTH = 800, GAME_HEIGHT = 600

Vulnerability: missing input validation
Issue: the function check_collisions does not validate its input, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors
Solution: add input validation to check_collisions, e.g., check if snake is an instance of the expected class and if its coordinates are valid

================================================================================
Here are the test scenarios for the `snake_game.check_collisions` method:

**Scenario 1: Collision with game boundaries (left)**
Details:
  TestName: `test_collision_with_left_boundary`
  Description: Verify that the function returns `True` when the snake's head collides with the left game boundary.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `snake` object with its head at `(0, 10)` and a set of coordinates.
  Act: Call `check_collisions(snake)`.
  Assert: The function returns `True`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly detects collisions with the game boundaries, which is a critical aspect of the snake game's business logic.

**Scenario 2: Collision with game boundaries (right)**
Details:
  TestName: `test_collision_with_right_boundary`
  Description: Verify that the function returns `True` when the snake's head collides with the right game boundary.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `snake` object with its head at `(GAME_WIDTH - 1, 10)` and a set of coordinates.
  Act: Call `check_collisions(snake)`.
  Assert: The function returns `True`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly detects collisions with the game boundaries, which is a critical aspect of the snake game's business logic.

**Scenario 3: Collision with game boundaries (top)**
Details:
  TestName: `test_collision_with_top_boundary`
  Description: Verify that the function returns `True` when the snake's head collides with the top game boundary.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `snake` object with its head at `(10, 0)` and a set of coordinates.
  Act: Call `check_collisions(snake)`.
  Assert: The function returns `True`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly detects collisions with the game boundaries, which is a critical aspect of the snake game's business logic.

**Scenario 4: Collision with game boundaries (bottom)**
Details:
  TestName: `test_collision_with_bottom_boundary`
  Description: Verify that the function returns `True` when the snake's head collides with the bottom game boundary.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `snake` object with its head at `(10, GAME_HEIGHT - 1)` and a set of coordinates.
  Act: Call `check_collisions(snake)`.
  Assert: The function returns `True`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly detects collisions with the game boundaries, which is a critical aspect of the snake game's business logic.

**Scenario 5: Self-collision (head touches body)**
Details:
  TestName: `test_self_collision`
  Description: Verify that the function returns `True` when the snake's head collides with its own body.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `snake` object with its head at `(10, 10)` and a set of coordinates that includes the head position.
  Act: Call `check_collisions(snake)`.
  Assert: The function returns `True`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly detects self-collisions, which is a critical aspect of the snake game's business logic.

**Scenario 6: No collision**
Details:
  TestName: `test_no_collision`
  Description: Verify that the function returns `False` when the snake's head does not collide with the game boundaries or its own body.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `snake` object with its head at `(10, 10)` and a set of coordinates that do not include the head position.
  Act: Call `check_collisions(snake)`.
  Assert: The function returns `False`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly returns `False` when there is no collision, which is a critical aspect of the snake game's business logic.

These test scenarios cover the expected behavior, edge cases, and error conditions for the `snake_game.check_collisions` method.
