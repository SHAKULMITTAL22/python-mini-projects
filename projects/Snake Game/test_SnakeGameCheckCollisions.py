================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not validate or sanitize the 'snake' parameter passed to the 'check_collisions' function. This could allow an attacker to pass malicious input and potentially exploit the application.
Solution: Implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques to ensure that the 'snake' parameter contains only expected and safe values. Use Python's built-in validation functions or libraries to validate and sanitize user input before processing it.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: The code does not impose any limits on the size of the 'snake' object or the number of coordinates it can contain. An attacker could potentially create a large 'snake' object with a high number of coordinates, leading to excessive memory consumption and potential denial-of-service conditions.
Solution: Implement resource limits and enforce boundaries on the size and complexity of the 'snake' object. Validate the number of coordinates and ensure it stays within acceptable limits. Implement proper error handling and graceful degradation mechanisms to handle excessive resource consumption attempts.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Snake collides with the left boundary of the game area
Details:
  TestName: test_check_collisions_left_boundary
  Description: This test verifies that the check_collisions function correctly detects when the snake's head collides with the left boundary of the game area.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a snake object with coordinates where the x-coordinate of the head is less than 0.
  Act: Call the check_collisions function with the snake object as the argument.
  Assert: The function should return True, indicating a collision.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the game correctly identifies collisions with the left boundary, preventing the snake from moving outside the designated game area. It aligns with the business requirement of keeping the snake within the defined boundaries.

Scenario 2: Snake collides with the right boundary of the game area
Details:
  TestName: test_check_collisions_right_boundary
  Description: This test verifies that the check_collisions function correctly detects when the snake's head collides with the right boundary of the game area.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a snake object with coordinates where the x-coordinate of the head is greater than or equal to GAME_WIDTH.
  Act: Call the check_collisions function with the snake object as the argument.
  Assert: The function should return True, indicating a collision.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the game correctly identifies collisions with the right boundary, preventing the snake from moving outside the designated game area. It aligns with the business requirement of keeping the snake within the defined boundaries.

Scenario 3: Snake collides with the top boundary of the game area
Details:
  TestName: test_check_collisions_top_boundary
  Description: This test verifies that the check_collisions function correctly detects when the snake's head collides with the top boundary of the game area.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a snake object with coordinates where the y-coordinate of the head is less than 0.
  Act: Call the check_collisions function with the snake object as the argument.
  Assert: The function should return True, indicating a collision.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the game correctly identifies collisions with the top boundary, preventing the snake from moving outside the designated game area. It aligns with the business requirement of keeping the snake within the defined boundaries.

Scenario 4: Snake collides with the bottom boundary of the game area
Details:
  TestName: test_check_collisions_bottom_boundary
  Description: This test verifies that the check_collisions function correctly detects when the snake's head collides with the bottom boundary of the game area.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a snake object with coordinates where the y-coordinate of the head is greater than or equal to GAME_HEIGHT.
  Act: Call the check_collisions function with the snake object as the argument.
  Assert: The function should return True, indicating a collision.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the game correctly identifies collisions with the bottom boundary, preventing the snake from moving outside the designated game area. It aligns with the business requirement of keeping the snake within the defined boundaries.

Scenario 5: Snake collides with its own body
Details:
  TestName: test_check_collisions_self_collision
  Description: This test verifies that the check_collisions function correctly detects when the snake's head collides with any part of its own body.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a snake object with coordinates where the head's position matches a body part's position.
  Act: Call the check_collisions function with the snake object as the argument.
  Assert: The function should return True, indicating a collision.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the game correctly identifies self-collisions, preventing the snake from overlapping with its own body. It aligns with the business requirement of enforcing valid snake movement and game over conditions.

Scenario 6: Snake does not collide with any boundaries or itself
Details:
  TestName: test_check_collisions_no_collision
  Description: This test verifies that the check_collisions function correctly detects when the snake is not colliding with any boundaries or itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a snake object with coordinates where the head is within the valid game area and not overlapping with any body parts.
  Act: Call the check_collisions function with the snake object as the argument.
  Assert: The function should return False, indicating no collision.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the game correctly identifies the absence of collisions when the snake is moving within the valid game area and not overlapping with itself. It aligns with the business requirement of allowing smooth gameplay when no collisions occur.
