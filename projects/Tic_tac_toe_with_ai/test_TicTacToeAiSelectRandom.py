================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Redundant Import
Issue: The 'random' module is imported twice, which is unnecessary and can potentially slow down the execution of the program.
Solution: Remove the redundant import statement.

Vulnerability: Insecure Randomness
Issue: The 'random' module is not cryptographically secure. If this function is used in a context where secure randomness is required (e.g., generating a random password), it could be exploited.
Solution: If secure randomness is required, use a function from a module like 'secrets' that is designed for generating cryptographically secure random numbers.

Vulnerability: Unnecessary Code
Issue: The 'random' module is imported again within the selectRandom function, which is redundant and can slow down the execution of the function.
Solution: Remove the unnecessary import statement within the function. All imports should be done at the beginning of the script.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to verify if the function returns a value present within the board 
Details:
  TestName: test_selectRandom_returns_value_from_board
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function selectRandom returns a value that is present within the input list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list with known values.
  Act: Call the function selectRandom with the prepared list.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is present within the input list.
Validation:
  This test is important as it will verify that the function is correctly selecting a random value from the provided list, and not returning an incorrect or out of range value.

Scenario 2: Test to verify if the function returns different values for different calls
Details:
  TestName: test_selectRandom_returns_different_values
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function selectRandom returns different values for different calls, ensuring randomness.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list with known values.
  Act: Call the function selectRandom with the prepared list multiple times.
  Assert: Check that the returned values are not the same for each call.
Validation:
  This test is important as it will verify that the function is correctly implementing randomness when selecting a value from the provided list.

Scenario 3: Test to verify if the function throws an error for an empty list
Details:
  TestName: test_selectRandom_throws_error_for_empty_list
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function selectRandom throws an error when an empty list is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an empty list.
  Act: Call the function selectRandom with the empty list.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be raised.
Validation:
  This test is important as it will verify that the function is correctly handling edge cases, such as an empty input list, and throwing an appropriate error.

Scenario 4: Test to verify if the function can handle a large list
Details:
  TestName: test_selectRandom_can_handle_large_list
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function selectRandom can handle a large list without any performance issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a large list with known values.
  Act: Call the function selectRandom with the large list.
  Assert: Check that the function returns a value within a reasonable time frame.
Validation:
  This test is important as it will verify that the function can handle large input lists without any performance issues or errors.
