================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Redundant Import (CWE-116)
Issue: The 'random' module is imported twice, which can lead to confusion and potential issues if the module's functions are used later in the code.
Solution: Remove the duplicate 'import random' statement.

Vulnerability: Undefined Function (CWE-758)
Issue: The 'space_check' function is referred to in 'full_board_check' function, but it's not defined anywhere in the code. This can lead to a NameError at runtime.
Solution: Define the 'space_check' function or import it from a module if it's defined elsewhere.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Full Board Check with Empty Spaces
Details:
  TestName: test_full_board_check_with_empty_spaces
  Description: This test verifies if the function correctly identifies a board that is not full, i.e., there are some empty spaces on the board.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board with some empty spaces.
  Act: Invoke the full_board_check function with the initialized board as a parameter.
  Assert: The function should return False, indicating the board is not full.
Validation:
  The test is important as it checks the primary functionality of the method, ensuring that it can correctly identify a board that is not full.

Scenario 2: Full Board Check with No Empty Spaces
Details:
  TestName: test_full_board_check_with_no_empty_spaces
  Description: This test verifies if the function correctly identifies a board that is full, i.e., there are no empty spaces on the board.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board with no empty spaces.
  Act: Invoke the full_board_check function with the initialized board as a parameter.
  Assert: The function should return True, indicating the board is full.
Validation:
  The test is crucial as it validates the method's ability to correctly identify a fully occupied board, which is a key requirement for determining a draw in the game.

Scenario 3: Full Board Check with Single Empty Space
Details:
  TestName: test_full_board_check_with_single_empty_space
  Description: This test verifies if the function can correctly identify a board with a single empty space.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board with a single empty space.
  Act: Invoke the full_board_check function with the initialized board as a parameter.
  Assert: The function should return False, indicating the board is not full.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the method's ability to correctly identify even a single empty space on the board, ensuring accurate detection of a draw situation.

Scenario 4: Full Board Check with All Empty Spaces
Details:
  TestName: test_full_board_check_with_all_empty_spaces
  Description: This test verifies if the function correctly identifies a board where all spaces are empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board with all empty spaces.
  Act: Invoke the full_board_check function with the initialized board as a parameter.
  Assert: The function should return False, indicating the board is not full.
Validation:
  The test is crucial as it validates the method's ability to correctly identify a completely empty board, ensuring accurate detection of the start or reset state of the game.
