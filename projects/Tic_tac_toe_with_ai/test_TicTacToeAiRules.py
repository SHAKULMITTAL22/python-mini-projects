================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Redundant import statements
Issue: The 'random' module is imported twice, which is unnecessary and can lead to confusion.
Solution: Remove the duplicate import statement.

Vulnerability: Unused imports
Issue: The 'random' and 'time' modules are imported but not used, which can lead to confusion and unnecessary code.
Solution: Remove the unused import statements.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Ensure the correct board layout is printed
Details:
  TestName: test_print_board_layout
  Description: This test will ensure that the printed board layout matches the expected 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board layout.
Execution:
  Arrange: Capture the standard output.
  Act: Call the rules() function.
  Assert: Check if the captured output matches the expected board layout.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the board layout is printed correctly. This is critical as it communicates to the player how the game board is structured and how to make a move.

Scenario 2: Ensure the correct positions are printed
Details:
  TestName: test_print_positions
  Description: This test will ensure that the printed positions match the expected positions from 1 to 9.
Execution:
  Arrange: Capture the standard output.
  Act: Call the rules() function.
  Assert: Check if the captured output contains the expected positions from 1 to 9.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the positions are printed correctly. This is important as it guides the player on the valid input positions they can enter when playing the game.

Scenario 3: Ensure the correct instructions are printed
Details:
  TestName: test_print_instructions
  Description: This test will ensure that the printed instructions are present and correct.
Execution:
  Arrange: Capture the standard output.
  Act: Call the rules() function.
  Assert: Check if the captured output contains the expected instructions.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the instructions are printed correctly. This is crucial as it informs the player about how to interact with the game, particularly in terms of inputting their desired position.

Scenario 4: Ensure the function does not return anything
Details:
  TestName: test_rules_return
  Description: This test will ensure that the rules() function does not return any value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement necessary for this test.
  Act: Call the rules() function and store its return value.
  Assert: Check if the return value is None.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the rules() function does not return anything, which is expected as its purpose is to print the game rules and not to produce a return value.
