================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Redundant imports
Issue: The 'random' module is imported twice. Although this is not a security issue per se, it could lead to confusion and potential issues in larger codebases.
Solution: Remove the redundant import statement.

Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: There's no validation of the 'position' input in the 'place_marker' function. If the 'position' is outside the range of the 'board' or 'avail' lists, this will result in an IndexError.
Solution: Add validation to check if the 'position' is within the acceptable range before using it to index the 'board' and 'avail' lists.

Vulnerability: Unused imports
Issue: The 'random' and 'time' modules are imported but not used. Unused imports could lead to unnecessary memory usage.
Solution: Remove the unused import statements.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful Placement of Marker in Empty Position
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_placement
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function can successfully place a marker in an empty position on the board.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board and avail list with a certain size, and set a position in the avail list to ' '. Also, prepare a marker choice.
  Act: Call the function place_marker with the initialized board, avail list, marker choice, and the chosen position.
  Assert: Check if the marker choice has been successfully placed in the specified position on the board, and if the corresponding position in the avail list has been set to ' '.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of the test, it ensures that the function can successfully place a marker in an empty position, which is a fundamental requirement for the game.

Scenario 2: Replacement of Existing Marker
Details:
  TestName: test_marker_replacement
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function can replace an existing marker on the board.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board and avail list with a certain size, and place a marker in a certain position. Also, prepare another marker choice.
  Act: Call the function place_marker with the initialized board, avail list, the new marker choice, and the position that already has a marker.
  Assert: Check if the new marker choice has replaced the existing marker in the specified position on the board, and if the corresponding position in the avail list has been set to ' '.
Validation:
  This test is significant because it ensures that the function can replace an existing marker, which can be a requirement in some versions of the game.

Scenario 3: Placement of Marker in Out-of-Bounds Position
Details:
  TestName: test_out_of_bounds_placement
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function throws an exception when trying to place a marker in a position that is out of bounds of the board.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board and avail list with a certain size, and prepare a marker choice and a position that is out of bounds of the board.
  Act: Call the function place_marker with the initialized board, avail list, marker choice, and the out-of-bounds position.
  Assert: Check if an exception is thrown.
Validation:
  The importance of this test lies in ensuring that the function handles out-of-bounds positions correctly, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the game.
