================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Import Statement Misuse
Issue: The 'time' module is imported twice, and once inside a function. This is not a security issue, but it is a bad practice that could lead to confusion and errors.
Solution: Import all necessary modules at the beginning of your script only once.

Vulnerability: Use of Sleep Function
Issue: The use of time.sleep function can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) if used incorrectly, as it can make the program unresponsive or slow.
Solution: Avoid using sleep function as much as possible, especially with user supplied input.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Verify the function when mode equals 2
Details:
  TestName: test_function_delay_mode_2
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function delay correctly executes the time.sleep(2) when the mode equals 2.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required.
  Act: Call the delay function with mode equals 2.
  Assert: Verify that the function's execution time is approximately 2 seconds.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function delay correctly interprets the mode parameter and applies the sleep function accordingly. The expected result aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements, ensuring that the function can introduce a delay of 2 seconds when required.

Scenario 2: Verify the function when mode does not equal 2
Details:
  TestName: test_function_delay_mode_not_2
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function delay does not execute the time.sleep(2) when the mode does not equal 2.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required.
  Act: Call the delay function with mode not equal to 2.
  Assert: Verify that the function's execution time is less than 2 seconds.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function delay correctly interprets the mode parameter and only applies the sleep function when the mode equals 2. The expected result aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements, ensuring that the function does not introduce unnecessary delays.

Scenario 3: Verify the function when mode equals 2 multiple times
Details:
  TestName: test_function_delay_mode_2_multiple_times
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function delay correctly executes the time.sleep(2) each time it is called with mode equals 2.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required.
  Act: Call the delay function with mode equals 2 multiple times.
  Assert: Verify that the function's execution time is approximately 2 seconds for each call.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function delay can be called multiple times and consistently introduce a delay of 2 seconds when required. The expected result aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements, ensuring that the function can introduce a delay of 2 seconds each time it is called with mode equals 2.
