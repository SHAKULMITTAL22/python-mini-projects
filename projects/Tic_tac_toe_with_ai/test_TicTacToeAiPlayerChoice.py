================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unvalidated user input
Issue: The input function is used without any validation which can lead to code injection attacks. An attacker can provide input that can manipulate or harm the system.
Solution: Always validate user inputs. Use int() function to make sure the user enters an integer and handle the ValueError exception that can be raised if a non-integer value is entered.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
Issue: The player_choice function directly uses user input to reference an object (board position). An attacker can abuse this to access or manipulate data they should not have access to.
Solution: Implement access control checks or other indirect reference maps so users cannot directly manipulate object references.

Vulnerability: Duplicate imports
Issue: The random module is imported twice which is unnecessary and can lead to confusion and errors.
Solution: Remove duplicate imports to keep the code clean and maintainable.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Player chooses a valid position on the board
Details:
  TestName: test_player_choice_valid_position
  Description: This test verifies that when a player chooses a valid position on the board, the function accepts the input and returns the position.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board with some empty spaces and a player with a valid name and choice.
  Act: Invoke the function player_choice with the initialized board, player name, and choice.
  Assert: Check that the returned position is equal to the input position.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly processes valid inputs and returns the expected output.

Scenario 2: Player chooses an occupied position on the board
Details:
  TestName: test_player_choice_occupied_position
  Description: This test verifies that when a player chooses an already occupied position on the board, the function does not accept the input and requests a new position.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board with no empty spaces and a player with a valid name and choice.
  Act: Invoke the function player_choice with the initialized board, player name, and choice.
  Assert: Check that the function asks for a new position.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles inputs where the chosen position is already occupied.

Scenario 3: Player chooses an invalid position on the board
Details:
  TestName: test_player_choice_invalid_position
  Description: This test verifies that when a player chooses an invalid position on the board (i.e., a position not in the range 1-9), the function does not accept the input and requests a new position.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board with some empty spaces and a player with a valid name and choice.
  Act: Invoke the function player_choice with the initialized board, player name, and choice, but with an invalid position.
  Assert: Check that the function asks for a new position.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles inputs where the chosen position is not within the valid range.

Scenario 4: Player does not enter a position
Details:
  TestName: test_player_choice_empty_position
  Description: This test verifies that when a player does not enter a position, the function does not accept the input and requests a new position.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board with some empty spaces and a player with a valid name and choice.
  Act: Invoke the function player_choice with the initialized board, player name, and choice, but without entering a position.
  Assert: Check that the function asks for a new position.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles inputs where the player does not enter a position.
