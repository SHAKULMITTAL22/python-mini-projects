================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Redundant Import (CWE-116)
Issue: The 'random' module is imported twice, which is unnecessary and could lead to confusion or errors if the code is modified in the future.
Solution: Remove the duplicate import statement for better code readability and maintenance.

Vulnerability: Unvalidated Input (CWE-20)
Issue: The function 'space_check' does not validate the 'position' input. If an invalid position is passed (e.g., a position outside the board's range), this could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
Solution: Validate the 'position' input to ensure it's within the acceptable range before using it.

Vulnerability: Unused Imports (CWE-116)
Issue: The 'random' and 'time' modules are imported but not used in the code. This unnecessary code could confuse developers and make maintenance more difficult.
Solution: Remove unused imports for better code readability and maintenance.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test when the given position is empty
Details:
  TestName: test_space_check_empty_position
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly identifies when a position on the board is empty, denoted by a space character.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board with a known empty position. For example, a board could be a list of 9 elements where the 5th position is an empty space.
  Act: Invoke the function with the board and the index of the known empty position.
  Assert: The function should return True, indicating that the position is indeed empty.
Validation:
  This test is important because the function should be able to correctly identify empty positions. This is crucial for the gameplay, as players can only place their marker on empty positions.

Scenario 2: Test when the given position is occupied
Details:
  TestName: test_space_check_occupied_position
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly identifies when a position on the board is occupied, denoted by any character other than a space.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board with a known occupied position. For example, a board could be a list of 9 elements where the 5th position is occupied by a 'X' or 'O'.
  Act: Invoke the function with the board and the index of the known occupied position.
  Assert: The function should return False, indicating that the position is occupied.
Validation:
  This test is important because the function should be able to correctly identify occupied positions. This is crucial for the gameplay, as players should not be able to place their marker on occupied positions.

Scenario 3: Test with a position that is out of the board's range
Details:
  TestName: test_space_check_out_of_range_position
  Description: This test is intended to check the behavior of the function when provided with a position that is outside the range of the board.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board with a known number of positions. For example, a board could be a list of 9 elements.
  Act: Invoke the function with the board and a position that is outside the range of the board (e.g., 10 for a 9-element board).
  Assert: The function should throw an IndexError.
Validation:
  This test is important because it ensures that the function handles out-of-range positions correctly, which is crucial for the integrity of the game and the prevention of unexpected errors.
