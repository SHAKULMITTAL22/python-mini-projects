================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The method for checking user input (X or O) is not properly validated. An adversary could potentially inject malicious code or commands into the input field.
Solution: Implement proper input validation. Ensure that only 'X' or 'O' (case insensitive) can be inputted by the user.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Printing 'INVALID INPUT! Please Try Again!' directly exposes system information to the user, which could give potential attackers clues about the systemâ€™s inner workings.
Solution: Use a more generic error message that does not provide potential attackers with any system information.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: The code is susceptible to an infinite loop if the user doesn't input 'X' or 'O'. This could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by consuming system resources.
Solution: Implement a counter or a timeout for the input loop to prevent infinite loops.

Vulnerability: CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: The input() function is used in this code. It can be dangerous as it might allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the application's context.
Solution: Avoid using the input() function or ensure its use is in a safe context where an attacker cannot exploit it to execute arbitrary code.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Player1 Selects 'X'
Details:
  TestName: test_choice_when_player1_selects_X
  Description: This test verifies that when player1 selects 'X', the function assigns 'O' to player2 and returns the tuple ('X', 'O').
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return 'X' when called.
  Act: Call the choice function.
  Assert: Check that the returned tuple is ('X', 'O').
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies the business logic for assigning player choices based on the input provided by player1. The expected result aligns with the function's specifications and ensures that the game can proceed with the correct player choices.

Scenario 2: Player1 Selects 'O'
Details:
  TestName: test_choice_when_player1_selects_O
  Description: This test verifies that when player1 selects 'O', the function assigns 'X' to player2 and returns the tuple ('O', 'X').
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return 'O' when called.
  Act: Call the choice function.
  Assert: Check that the returned tuple is ('O', 'X').
Validation:
  This test is critical because it ensures the function correctly assigns player choices when player1 selects 'O'. The expected result aligns with the function's specifications, ensuring that the game can proceed with the correct player choices.

Scenario 3: Player1 Enters Incorrect Input
Details:
  TestName: test_choice_when_player1_enters_incorrect_input
  Description: This test verifies that the function prompts for re-entry when player1 enters an incorrect input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return a non-'X' or 'O' value on the first call, and 'X' on the second call.
  Act: Call the choice function.
  Assert: Check that the function still returns the tuple ('X', 'O') despite the initial incorrect input.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies the function's ability to handle incorrect inputs and prompt for re-entry, which aligns with the function's specifications and ensures smooth gameplay.

Scenario 4: Player1 Enters Lowercase Input
Details:
  TestName: test_choice_when_player1_enters_lowercase_input
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles and interprets lowercase inputs from player1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return 'x' when called.
  Act: Call the choice function.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the tuple ('X', 'O').
Validation:
  This test is critical because it ensures the function's ability to handle and correctly interpret lowercase inputs, which aligns with the function's specifications and enhances user experience by providing a wider input window.
