================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Deserialization (CVE-2017-7233)
Issue: The 'eval()' function used in the 'requests.get(website)' line can potentially lead to remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, as it deserializes untrusted input. This could be exploited by an attacker by providing a malicious URL.
Solution: Replace the 'eval()' function with a safer alternative, such as 'json.loads(requests.get(website).text)' to parse JSON responses. Additionally, consider validating and sanitizing user input or using a library with built-in security measures to deserialize untrusted data.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) (CWE-639)
Issue: The code snippet does not validate user-supplied input, which may allow attackers to access unauthorized resources by manipulating the 'website' variable.
Solution: Implement proper input validation and sanitization for user-supplied input. Consider using a library like 'validators' to ensure that URLs are well-formed and safe. Additionally, use a session object or a similar mechanism to manage user access and prevent unauthorized access to resources.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Verify correct functionality with a working website
Details:
  TestName: test_working_website
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly reports a website as "working" when it is accessible and returns a HTTP status code of 200.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a text file named "websites.txt" containing a single line with a working website URL.
  Act: Call the main() function.
  Assert: Check that the generated "website_status.csv" file contains the website URL with the status "working".
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the basic case of a working website, verifying the core functionality of the system.

Scenario 2: Verify correct functionality with a non-working website
Details:
  TestName: test_non_working_website
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly reports a website as "not working" when it is not accessible and returns a HTTP status code other than 200.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a text file named "websites.txt" containing a single line with a non-working website URL.
  Act: Call the main() function.
  Assert: Check that the generated "website_status.csv" file contains the website URL with the status "not working".
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case of a non-working website, verifying the robustness of the system.

Scenario 3: Verify functionality with multiple websites in the input file
Details:
  TestName: test_multiple_websites
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly processes multiple websites listed in the input file, generating the appropriate status for each one in the output CSV file.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a text file named "websites.txt" containing multiple lines with a mix of working and non-working website URLs.
  Act: Call the main() function.
  Assert: Check that the generated "website_status.csv" file contains all the website URLs with the correct corresponding statuses.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle multiple websites and correctly report their statuses, testing the scalability of the system.

Scenario 4: Verify functionality with an empty input file
Details:
  TestName: test_empty_input_file
  Description: This test verifies that the function does not raise an exception and correctly handles an empty input file by not generating an output CSV file.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an empty text file named "websites.txt".
  Act: Call the main() function.
  Assert: Check that no output CSV file is generated.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can gracefully handle an empty input file, testing its error handling capabilities.

Scenario 5: Verify functionality with a non-existent input file
Details:
  TestName: test_non_existent_input_file
  Description: This test verifies that the function raises an appropriate exception when the input file does not exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure that no file named "websites.txt" is present in the working directory.
  Act: Call the main() function.
  Assert: Catch the expected FileNotFoundError exception.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle the case where the input file is missing, testing its error handling capabilities.

Scenario 6: Verify functionality when writing to a read-only output file
Details:
  TestName: test_read_only_output_file
  Description: This test verifies that the function raises an appropriate exception when attempting to write to a read-only output file.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a read-only CSV file named "website_status.csv" in the working directory.
  Act: Call the main() function.
  Assert: Catch the expected PermissionError exception.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle the case where the output file is read-only, testing its error handling capabilities.
