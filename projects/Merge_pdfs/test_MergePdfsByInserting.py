================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: insecure file operations
Issue: the code merges pdf files without checking user input, allowing for potential file tampering or arbitrary file access
Solution: use secure file operations, validate user input, and consider using secure temporary files

Vulnerability: cwe-829: inadequate verification of trust boundaries
Issue: the code trusts the pdf files and does not verify their contents, potentially leading to malware injection or data leakage
Solution: validate and sanitize pdf file contents before merging, and consider using digital signatures or encryption

Vulnerability: depending on a single third-party package
Issue: the code relies solely on PyPDF2, which may have its own vulnerabilities or limitations, potentially impacting the overall security of the application
Solution: consider using alternative packages or implementing a fallback mechanism to ensure robustness and flexibility

================================================================================
Here are the pytest test scenarios for the `by_inserting` method:

**Scenario 1: Successful PDF merging**
Details:
  TestName: testsuccessful_merging
  Description: Verify that the `by_inserting` function merges two PDF files successfully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure "samplePdf1.pdf" and "samplePdf2.pdf" exist in the current directory.
  Act: Call the `by_inserting` function.
  Assert: Check that a new "mergedPdf1.pdf" file has been created in the current directory.
Validation:
  This test ensures the basic functionality of the `by_inserting` function, which is to merge two PDF files into a single PDF.

**Scenario 2: Non-existent source PDF file**
Details:
  TestName: test_non_existent_source_pdf
  Description: Verify that the `by_inserting` function raises an error when a source PDF file does not exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure "samplePdf1.pdf" does not exist in the current directory.
  Act: Call the `by_inserting` function.
  Assert: Check that a `FileNotFoundError` is raised.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the `by_inserting` function handles the case where a source PDF file does not exist.

**Scenario 3: Non-existent target PDF file**
Details:
  TestName: test_non_existent_target_pdf
  Description: Verify that the `by_inserting` function raises an error when a target PDF file already exists.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure "mergedPdf1.pdf" already exists in the current directory.
  Act: Call the `by_inserting` function.
  Assert: Check that an `IOError` is raised.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the `by_inserting` function handles the case where a target PDF file already exists.

**Scenario 4: Invalid PDF file**
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_pdf_file
  Description: Verify that the `by_inserting` function raises an error when an invalid PDF file is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a file "samplePdf1.pdf" with invalid PDF content.
  Act: Call the `by_inserting` function.
  Assert: Check that a `PdfReadError` is raised.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the `by_inserting` function handles the case where an invalid PDF file is provided.

**Scenario 5: PDF file merge order**
Details:
  TestName: test_pdf_merge_order
  Description: Verify that the `by_inserting` function merges PDF files in the correct order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create "samplePdf1.pdf" and "samplePdf2.pdf" with distinct content.
  Act: Call the `by_inserting` function.
  Assert: Check that the content of "mergedPdf1.pdf" matches the expected order.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `by_inserting` function merges PDF files in the correct order.

**Scenario 6: Multiple calls to the `by_inserting` function**
Details:
  TestName: test_multiple_calls
  Description: Verify that the `by_inserting` function can be called multiple times without errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call the `by_inserting` function multiple times.
  Assert: Check that each call successfully merges the PDF files.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `by_inserting` function can be called multiple times without errors or side effects.

**Scenario 7: Permission errors**
Details:
  TestName: test_permission_error
  Description: Verify that the `by_inserting` function raises an error when it does not have permission to read or write PDF files.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set permissions to deny read or write access to "samplePdf1.pdf" or "mergedPdf1.pdf".
  Act: Call the `by_inserting` function.
  Assert: Check that a `PermissionError` is raised.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the `by_inserting` function handles permission errors when reading or writing PDF files.
