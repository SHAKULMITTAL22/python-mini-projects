Here are the test scenarios for the `move_ball` method:

**Scenario 1: Ball moves without collision**
Details:
  TestName: test_move_ball_no_collision
  Description: Verify that the ball's position is updated based on its velocity when there is no collision with walls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the ball object with a velocity and position not near the walls.
  Act: Call the `move_ball` method.
  Assert: Check that the ball's position has changed according to its velocity.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the ball's movement is correctly updated when there is no collision, which is the primary function of the `move_ball` method.

**Scenario 2: Ball collides with left or right wall**
Details:
  TestName: test_move_ball_wall_collision_horizontal
  Description: Verify that the ball's velocity is reversed when it collides with the left or right wall.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the ball object with a velocity and position near the left or right wall.
  Act: Call the `move_ball` method.
  Assert: Check that the ball's velocity X component has changed sign and the position has been updated accordingly.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the ball's collision with the walls is correctly handled, which is a critical aspect of the game's physics.

**Scenario 3: Ball collides with top wall**
Details:
  TestName: test_move_ball_wall_collision_top
  Description: Verify that the ball's velocity is reversed and its position is corrected when it collides with the top wall.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the ball object with a velocity and position near the top wall.
  Act: Call the `move_ball` method.
  Assert: Check that the ball's velocity Y component has changed sign, its position has been set to the top wall, and its Y velocity is negative.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the ball's collision with the top wall is correctly handled, which is essential for the game's physics.

**Scenario 4: Ball collides with bottom wall**
Details:
  TestName: test_move_ball_wall_collision_bottom
  Description: Verify that the ball's velocity is reversed and its position is corrected when it collides with the bottom wall.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the ball object with a velocity and position near the bottom wall.
  Act: Call the `move_ball` method.
  Assert: Check that the ball's velocity Y component has changed sign, its position has been set to the bottom wall, and its Y velocity is positive.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the ball's collision with the bottom wall is correctly handled, which is essential for the game's physics.

**Scenario 5: Ball's position is updated correctly when velocity is zero**
Details:
  TestName: test_move_ball_zero_velocity
  Description: Verify that the ball's position is not updated when its velocity is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the ball object with a velocity of zero.
  Act: Call the `move_ball` method.
  Assert: Check that the ball's position has not changed.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the ball's movement is correctly handled when its velocity is zero, which is a valid scenario.

**Scenario 6: Ball's velocity is updated correctly due to gravity**
Details:
  TestName: test_move_ball_gravity
  Description: Verify that the ball's velocity Y component is updated correctly due to gravity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the ball object with a velocity and position.
  Act: Call the `move_ball` method multiple times.
  Assert: Check that the ball's velocity Y component has increased due to gravity.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the ball's acceleration due to gravity is correctly handled, which is a critical aspect of the game's physics.
