================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: insecure direct object reference
Issue: the win_conditions and squares variables are not defined within the scope of the check_win function, potentially leading to information disclosure or unauthorized access
Solution: ensure that win_conditions and squares are properly defined and validated within the check_win function, or pass them as arguments to the function

Vulnerability: cwe-20: invalid input
Issue: the check_win function does not perform adequate input validation on the player argument, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors
Solution: validate the player argument to ensure it conforms to expected formats and values, using techniques such as type checking and whitelisting

Vulnerability: cwe-732: incorrect permission assignment
Issue: the check_win function may be vulnerable to privilege escalation if the player argument is not properly sanitized, potentially allowing unauthorized access
Solution: ensure that the player argument is properly sanitized and validated to prevent privilege escalation attacks

================================================================================
Here are the pytest test scenarios for the `tic_tac_toe.check_win` method:

**Scenario 1: Winning condition met**
Details:
  TestName: test_check_win_winning_condition
  Description: Verifies that the function returns True when a winning condition is met.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `squares` list with a winning configuration for a player.
  Act: Call `check_win` with the winning player as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns True.
Validation: This test ensures that the function correctly identifies a winning condition, which is a critical aspect of the tic-tac-toe game's business logic.

**Scenario 2: No winning condition met**
Details:
  TestName: test_check_win_no_winning_condition
  Description: Verifies that the function returns False when no winning condition is met.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `squares` list with a non-winning configuration.
  Act: Call `check_win` with a player as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns False.
Validation: This test ensures that the function correctly handles cases where no player has won, which is essential for the game's flow.

**Scenario 3: Partially filled board**
Details:
  TestName: test_check_win_partially_filled_board
  Description: Verifies that the function returns False when the board is partially filled and no winning condition is met.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `squares` list with a partially filled board and no winning configuration.
  Act: Call `check_win` with a player as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns False.
Validation: This test ensures that the function correctly handles cases where the board is not fully filled, which is a common scenario in the game.

**Scenario 4: Empty board**
Details:
  TestName: test_check_win_empty_board
  Description: Verifies that the function returns False when the board is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `squares` list as empty.
  Act: Call `check_win` with a player as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns False.
Validation: This test ensures that the function correctly handles the edge case of an empty board, which is a valid input.

**Scenario 5: Multiple winning conditions**
Details:
  TestName: test_check_win_multiple_winning_conditions
  Description: Verifies that the function returns True when multiple winning conditions are met.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `squares` list with multiple winning configurations for a player.
  Act: Call `check_win` with the winning player as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns True.
Validation: This test ensures that the function correctly handles cases where multiple winning conditions are met, which is a possible scenario in the game.

**Scenario 6: Draw condition**
Details:
  TestName: test_check_win_draw_condition
  Description: Verifies that the function returns False when the game is a draw (all squares filled, no winner).
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `squares` list with a fully filled board and no winning configuration.
  Act: Call `check_win` with a player as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns False.
Validation: This test ensures that the function correctly handles the draw condition, which is a critical aspect of the game's business logic.
