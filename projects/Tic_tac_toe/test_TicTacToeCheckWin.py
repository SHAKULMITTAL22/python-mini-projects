================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: insecure direct object reference
Issue: the 'squares' variable is not defined within the function scope, potentially allowing unauthorized access to external data
Solution: define 'squares' as a function parameter or a local variable to ensure secure data access

Vulnerability: unvalidated user input
Issue: the 'player' variable is not validated, potentially allowing malicious input to affect the game logic
Solution: validate the 'player' variable using a whitelist approach to ensure only expected values are accepted

Vulnerability: insecure use of mutable default arguments
Issue: the 'win_conditions' variable is not defined within the function scope, potentially leading to unexpected behavior due to mutable default arguments
Solution: define 'win_conditions' as a function parameter or a local variable to avoid insecure use of mutable default arguments

================================================================================
Here are the pytest test scenarios for the `check_win` method:

**Scenario 1: Winning condition met**
Details:
  TestName: test_winning_condition_met
  Description: Verify that the function returns True when a winning condition is met.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `squares` with a winning configuration (e.g., three "X"s in a row).
  Act: Call `check_win` with the winning player ("X" or "O").
  Assert: The function returns True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly identifies a winning condition.

**Scenario 2: No winning condition**
Details:
  TestName: test_no_winning_condition
  Description: Verify that the function returns False when no winning condition is met.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `squares` with a non-winning configuration.
  Act: Call `check_win` with a player ("X" or "O").
  Assert: The function returns False.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles cases where no player has won.

**Scenario 3: Partially filled board**
Details:
  TestName: test_partially_filled_board
  Description: Verify that the function returns False when the board is partially filled and no winning condition is met.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `squares` with a partially filled board (some squares empty, some with players).
  Act: Call `check_win` with a player ("X" or "O").
  Assert: The function returns False.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles incomplete games correctly.

**Scenario 4: Empty board**
Details:
  TestName: test_empty_board
  Description: Verify that the function returns False when the board is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `squares` with an empty board.
  Act: Call `check_win` with a player ("X" or "O").
  Assert: The function returns False.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles an empty board.

**Scenario 5: Invalid player**
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_player
  Description: Verify that the function raises an error when an invalid player is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `squares` with a valid configuration.
  Act: Call `check_win` with an invalid player (e.g., "Z").
  Assert: The function raises a ValueError or similar exception.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles invalid input.

**Scenario 6: Winning condition with multiple players**
Details:
  TestName: test_winning_condition_multiple_players
  Description: Verify that the function returns True when a winning condition is met with multiple players.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `squares` with a winning configuration involving multiple players (e.g., "X" and "O" in a row).
  Act: Call `check_win` with one of the winning players.
  Assert: The function returns True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles winning conditions involving multiple players.
