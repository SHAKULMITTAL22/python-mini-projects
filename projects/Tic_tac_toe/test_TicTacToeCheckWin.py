================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: insecure direct object reference
Issue: the 'squares' variable is used without being defined in the provided code snippet, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if it's not properly defined elsewhere in the code
Solution: ensure 'squares' is properly defined and initialized before using it in the 'check_win' function

Vulnerability: insecure data origin
Issue: the 'win_conditions' variable is not defined in the provided code snippet, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if it's not properly defined elsewhere in the code
Solution: ensure 'win_conditions' is properly defined and initialized before using it in the 'check_win' function

Vulnerability: unvalidated user input
Issue: the 'player' parameter of the 'check_win' function is not validated, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if it's not a valid player
Solution: validate the 'player' parameter to ensure it's a valid player before using it in the 'check_win' function

================================================================================
Here are the pytest test scenarios for the `check_win` method:

**Scenario 1: Player wins when all three squares in a winning condition match**

Details:
  TestName: test_win_condition_met
  Description: Verify that the function returns True when a player occupies all three squares in a winning condition.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `squares` with a winning combination for a player (e.g., `squares = [None, 'X', 'X', 'X', None, None, None, None, None]`) and set `win_conditions` accordingly.
  Act: Call `check_win('X')`.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `True`.

Validation:
  The test ensures that the function correctly identifies a winning condition when a player occupies all three squares in a winning combination.

**Scenario 2: Player does not win when not all three squares in a winning condition match**

Details:
  TestName: test_win_condition_not_met
  Description: Verify that the function returns False when a player does not occupy all three squares in a winning condition.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `squares` with a non-winning combination for a player (e.g., `squares = [None, 'X', 'O', 'X', None, None, None, None, None]`) and set `win_conditions` accordingly.
  Act: Call `check_win('X')`.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `False`.

Validation:
  The test ensures that the function correctly identifies when a player does not occupy all three squares in a winning combination.

**Scenario 3: No winner when all squares are empty**

Details:
  TestName: test_no_winner_all_empty
  Description: Verify that the function returns False when all squares are empty.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `squares` with all empty values (e.g., `squares = [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]`) and set `win_conditions` accordingly.
  Act: Call `check_win('X')`.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `False`.

Validation:
  The test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where no player has made a move yet.

**Scenario 4: No winner when only one square is occupied**

Details:
  TestName: test_no_winner_one_occupied
  Description: Verify that the function returns False when only one square is occupied.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `squares` with only one occupied square (e.g., `squares = [None, 'X', None, None, None, None, None, None, None]`) and set `win_conditions` accordingly.
  Act: Call `check_win('X')`.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `False`.

Validation:
  The test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where a player has made a single move.

**Scenario 5: Player wins when winning condition is met with different square indices**

Details:
  TestName: test_win_condition_met_different_indices
  Description: Verify that the function returns True when a player occupies all three squares in a winning condition, regardless of the square indices.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `squares` with a winning combination for a player using different square indices (e.g., `squares = [None, None, None, 'X', 'X', 'X', None, None, None]`) and set `win_conditions` accordingly.
  Act: Call `check_win('X')`.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `True`.

Validation:
  The test ensures that the function correctly identifies a winning condition regardless of the square indices involved.

**Scenario 6: Function returns False when player is None**

Details:
  TestName: test_player_is_none
  Description: Verify that the function returns False when the player parameter is None.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `squares` with any combination and set `win_conditions` accordingly.
  Act: Call `check_win(None)`.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `False`.

Validation:
  The test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where the player parameter is None.
