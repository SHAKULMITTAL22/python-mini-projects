================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: cwe-20
Issue: the code uses user-controlled input (squares) without sanitization, which can lead to unexpected behavior or arbitrary code execution
Solution: use input validation and sanitization to ensure squares only contains expected values

Vulnerability: cwe-404
Issue: the code assumes win_conditions is defined, but it is not, which can cause a name error
Solution: ensure win_conditions is defined and initialized before using it

Vulnerability: cwe-573
Issue: the function check_win does not handle the case where player is not a single character, which can cause unexpected behavior
Solution: add input validation to ensure player is a single character

================================================================================
Here are the pytest test scenarios for the `check_win` method:

**Scenario 1: Winning condition met**
Details:
  TestName: test_check_win_winning_condition_met
  Description: Verify that the function returns True when a winning condition is met.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `squares` list with a winning combination (e.g., three 'X's in a row).
  Act: Call `check_win` with the winning player ('X' or 'O') as an argument.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function correctly identifies a winning condition and returns the expected result.

**Scenario 2: No winning condition met**
Details:
  TestName: test_check_win_no_winning_condition
  Description: Verify that the function returns False when no winning condition is met.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `squares` list with a non-winning combination (e.g., no three 'X's or 'O's in a row).
  Act: Call `check_win` with a player ('X' or 'O') as an argument.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function correctly handles cases where no winning condition is met and returns the expected result.

**Scenario 3: Partial winning condition**
Details:
  TestName: test_check_win_partial_winning_condition
  Description: Verify that the function returns False when only two squares of a winning condition are met.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `squares` list with a partial winning combination (e.g., two 'X's in a row, but not three).
  Act: Call `check_win` with the player ('X' or 'O') as an argument.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function correctly handles partial winning conditions and returns the expected result.

**Scenario 4: Empty squares list**
Details:
  TestName: test_check_win_empty_squares_list
  Description: Verify that the function raises an exception when the `squares` list is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `squares` list as an empty list.
  Act: Call `check_win` with a player ('X' or 'O') as an argument.
  Assert: Expect a ValueError or similar exception to be raised.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function handles edge cases where the `squares` list is empty, which is an invalid input.

**Scenario 5: Invalid player**
Details:
  TestName: test_check_win_invalid_player
  Description: Verify that the function raises an exception when an invalid player is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `squares` list with a valid combination.
  Act: Call `check_win` with an invalid player (e.g., 'Z' instead of 'X' or 'O') as an argument.
  Assert: Expect a ValueError or similar exception to be raised.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function handles edge cases where an invalid player is passed, which is an invalid input.

These test scenarios cover the expected behavior, edge cases, and error conditions for the `check_win` method.
