"""
In order to generate test scenarios for the `check_win` function of the `tic_tac_toe` code snippet you provided, I would need additional information about the global variables `win_conditions` and `squares`, since they are not local to the function and their values will affect the outcome of the `check_win` execution. Since `win_conditions` and `squares` are not defined in your snippet, I will assume standard Tic Tac Toe rules and a 3x3 board layout. 

Here are the test scenarios to validate the business logic of the `check_win` function, assuming standard Tic Tac Toe rules:

1. Horizontal Win:
    - Test that the function returns `True` when a player has all squares in any horizontal row.

2. Vertical Win:
    - Test that the function returns `True` when a player has all squares in any vertical column.

3. Diagonal Win:
    - Test that the function returns `True` when a player has all squares on either diagonal.

4. No Win:
    - Test that the function returns `False` when the squares do not form a line of the same player horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

5. Mixed Squares:
    - Test that the function returns `False` when the squares contain a mix of players' marks, and there is no winning combination.

6. Empty Squares:
    - Test that the function does not mistakenly return `True` when squares are empty (no player marks) and doesn't match the winning condition.

7. Partially Filled Board:
    - Test scenarios with a partially filled board to ensure that premature wins are not registered, and valid wins are recognized accurately.

8. Completely Filled Board Without a Winner:
    - Test that the function returns `False` on a completely filled board that has no winning combinations (a draw).

9. Board with Invalid Player Markers:
    - Test the function's behavior when squares contain symbols that are not associated with any player to make sure they are not misinterpreted as a win.

10. Win with Additional Filled Squares:
    - Test that the function correctly identifies a win when there are additional, non-critical marks on the board that do not contribute to the win condition but may appear in regular gameplay.

These test scenarios cover different game states that the `check_win` function must handle correctly. To implement these tests, you would typically set up the board (`squares` array) and `win_conditions` to reflect each scenario, call `check_win(player)` with the player who is presumed to win or not, and check the function's return value against the expected outcome (True or False).
