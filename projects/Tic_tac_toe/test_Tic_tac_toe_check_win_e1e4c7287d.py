"""
The code snippet provided is a method `check_win(player)` from a Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Python. This method is assumed to check if any player has won the game based on win conditions. The given information shows that the method works with a global variable `squares` which represents the state of the game board and a global variable `win_conditions` that holds the indices of board squares to check for a win. Here are several test scenarios to validate the business logic:

1. Test Win Condition - Horizontal:
   - Validate that the `check_win` function correctly identifies a win when a player has all their marks in a horizontal line.

2. Test Win Condition - Vertical:
   - Validate that the `check_win` function correctly identifies a win when a player has all their marks in a vertical line.

3. Test Win Condition - Diagonal:
   - Validate that the `check_win` function correctly identifies a win when a player has all their marks in a diagonal line.

4. Test No Win Condition - Mixed marks:
   - Validate that the `check_win` function returns False when the selected squares have a mix of players' marks without any win conditions met.

5. Test No Win Condition - All square occupied:
   - Validate that the `check_win` function returns False when all the squares are occupied but there is no winner.

6. Test No Win Condition - Empty board:
   - Validate that the `check_win` function returns False when the board is entirely empty.

7. Test Multiple Win Conditions:
   - Validate that the `check_win` function still returns True if there are multiple winning conditions met (for example, a player has two rows of their marks).

8. Test Win Priority Over Draw:
   - Ensure that the `check_win` function correctly identifies a win even when the last move fills the board (win should take priority over a draw).

9. Test for an unfilled winning line:
   - Validate that the `check_win` function does not accidentally identify a win when a winning line is partially filled.

10. Test robustness with unexpected player input:
    - Validate that the `check_win` function handles player input other than the traditional 'X' or 'O' (if allowed by the broader application logic).

Remember that these test scenarios are meant to validate the functionality and business logic of the `check_win` function, and they need to be implemented and executed in a test suite for them to be practically useful.
