"""
To validate the business logic of the function `tic_tac_toe.check_win`, we can define several test scenarios that cover the rules of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. These test scenarios should validate that the function accurately determines whether the `player` has won the game based on possible `win_conditions` and the current state of a `squares` board.

Here are the test scenarios:

1. **Win by Row**: Test the situations where the `player` has all three of their marks in any one of the three rows of the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
   - Test with the `player` occupying the top row.
   - Test with the `player` occupying the middle row.
   - Test with the `player` occupying the bottom row.

2. **Win by Column**: Test the situations where the `player` has all three of their marks in any one of the three columns of the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
   - Test with the `player` occupying the left column.
   - Test with the `player` occupying the middle column.
   - Test with the `player` occupying the right column.

3. **Win by Diagonal**: Test the situations where the `player` has all three of their marks in a diagonal line on the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
   - Test with the `player` occupying the diagonal from top-left to bottom-right.
   - Test with the `player` occupying the diagonal from bottom-left to top-right.

4. **No Win**: Test that the function returns `False` when the `player` has not met any of the `win_conditions`.
   - Test with the `player` having no consecutive squares.
   - Test with the `player` having two consecutive squares in any potential win condition, but not all three.
   - Test with a completely empty board.
   - Test with a board filled with alternating marks and no winner.

5. **Draw Scenario**: Although not directly checking for a win, verify that the function does not return `True` in a scenario where all squares are filled, but there is no winner.

6. **Interrupted Win Sequence**: Test scenarios where another player's mark interrupts a potential winning sequence.
   - Test with another player's mark interrupting a potential win by row.
   - Test with another player's mark interrupting a potential win by column.
   - Test with another player's mark interrupting a potential win by diagonal.

7. **Complex Board State**: Test with a board that has multiple winning combinations to confirm the function returns `True` if any one combination meets the win condition for the `player`.

8. **Pre-Win Scenario**: Test where the `player` is about to win but has not yet played the winning move.

To ensure reliability, each scenario should be run multiple times with various `player` marks and board states that represent the same conditions. During actual test code generation, it will be necessary to define the `win_conditions` and `squares` data that these scenarios assume to exist and operate correctly.
