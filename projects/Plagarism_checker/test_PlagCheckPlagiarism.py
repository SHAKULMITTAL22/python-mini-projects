Here are the pytest test scenarios for the `check_plagiarism` method:

**Scenario 1: Single Student with No Plagiarism**
Details:
  TestName: test_no_plagiarism_single_student
  Description: Verify that when there is only one student, no plagiarism is detected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `s_vectors` with a single student and their text vector.
  Act: Call `check_plagiarism()` with the prepared `s_vectors`.
  Assert: `plagiarism_results` is empty.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function does not incorrectly detect plagiarism when there is only one student.

**Scenario 2: Multiple Students with No Plagiarism**
Details:
  TestName: test_no_plagiarism_multiple_students
  Description: Verify that when multiple students have unique text vectors, no plagiarism is detected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `s_vectors` with multiple students, each with a unique text vector.
  Act: Call `check_plagiarism()` with the prepared `s_vectors`.
  Assert: `plagiarism_results` is empty.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles multiple students without detecting false positives.

**Scenario 3: Two Students with Identical Text Vectors (Plagiarism)**
Details:
  TestName: test_plagiarism_identical_text_vectors
  Description: Verify that when two students have identical text vectors, plagiarism is detected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `s_vectors` with two students, both with the same text vector.
  Act: Call `check_plagiarism()` with the prepared `s_vectors`.
  Assert: `plagiarism_results` contains a single entry with a high similarity score.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function detects plagiarism when students have identical text vectors.

**Scenario 4: Two Students with Similar Text Vectors (Partial Plagiarism)**
Details:
  TestName: test_partial_plagiarism_similar_text_vectors
  Description: Verify that when two students have similar text vectors, partial plagiarism is detected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `s_vectors` with two students, both with similar but not identical text vectors.
  Act: Call `check_plagiarism()` with the prepared `s_vectors`.
  Assert: `plagiarism_results` contains a single entry with a moderate similarity score.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function detects partial plagiarism when students have similar text vectors.

**Scenario 5: Empty `s_vectors` Input**
Details:
  TestName: test_empty_input
  Description: Verify that when `s_vectors` is empty, the function returns an empty `plagiarism_results`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `s_vectors` as an empty list.
  Act: Call `check_plagiarism()` with the empty `s_vectors`.
  Assert: `plagiarism_results` is empty.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles empty input correctly.

**Scenario 6: `s_vectors` Contains Non-Text Vectors**
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_input_non_text_vectors
  Description: Verify that when `s_vectors` contains non-text vectors, the function raises an exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `s_vectors` with a mix of text vectors and non-text vectors (e.g., integers).
  Act: Call `check_plagiarism()` with the prepared `s_vectors`.
  Assert: An exception is raised (e.g., `ValueError` or `TypeError`).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function fails gracefully when encountering invalid input.

**Scenario 7: `s_vectors` Contains Duplicate Student IDs**
Details:
  TestName: test_duplicate_student_ids
  Description: Verify that when `s_vectors` contains duplicate student IDs, the function handles them correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `s_vectors` with multiple students, including duplicates.
  Act: Call `check_plagiarism()` with the prepared `s_vectors`.
  Assert: `plagiarism_results` contains the expected plagiarism detections, ignoring duplicates.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles duplicate student IDs.

**Scenario 8: Edge Case: Very Large `s_vectors` Input**
Details:
  TestName: test_large_input
  Description: Verify that when `s_vectors` is very large, the function still detects plagiarism correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `s_vectors` with a large number of students and their text vectors.
  Act: Call `check_plagiarism()` with the prepared `s_vectors`.
  Assert: `plagiarism_results` contains the expected plagiarism detections.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function scales well with large input data.
