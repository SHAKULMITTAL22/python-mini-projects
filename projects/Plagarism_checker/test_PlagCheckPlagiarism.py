Here are the pytest test scenarios for the `check_plagiarism` method:

**Scenario 1: Single Student with No Similarity**
Details:
  TestName: `test_single_student_no_similarity`
  Description: Verify that when there is only one student, no plagiarism scores are generated.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `s_vectors` with a single student and their corresponding text vector.
  Act: Call `check_plagiarism()`.
  Assert: `plagiarism_results` is empty.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the function doesn't generate unnecessary scores when there is only one student.

**Scenario 2: Two Students with No Similarity**
Details:
  TestName: `test_two_students_no_similarity`
  Description: Verify that when two students have no similar text, no plagiarism scores are generated.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `s_vectors` with two students and their corresponding text vectors, ensuring they are dissimilar.
  Act: Call `check_plagiarism()`.
  Assert: `plagiarism_results` is empty.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles cases where students have no similar text.

**Scenario 3: Two Students with Similarity**
Details:
  TestName: `test_two_students_with_similarity`
  Description: Verify that when two students have similar text, a plagiarism score is generated.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `s_vectors` with two students and their corresponding text vectors, ensuring they are similar.
  Act: Call `check_plagiarism()`.
  Assert: `plagiarism_results` contains a score for the two students.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly identifies similar text between students.

**Scenario 4: Multiple Students with Similarity**
Details:
  TestName: `test_multiple_students_with_similarity`
  Description: Verify that when multiple students have similar text, plagiarism scores are generated for each pair.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `s_vectors` with multiple students and their corresponding text vectors, ensuring some are similar.
  Act: Call `check_plagiarism()`.
  Assert: `plagiarism_results` contains scores for each pair of students with similar text.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles cases with multiple students and identifies all similar text pairs.

**Scenario 5: Edge Case - Empty Input**
Details:
  TestName: `test_empty_input`
  Description: Verify that when `s_vectors` is empty, the function returns an empty `plagiarism_results`.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `s_vectors` as an empty list.
  Act: Call `check_plagiarism()`.
  Assert: `plagiarism_results` is empty.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles edge cases where there is no input data.

**Scenario 6: Error Condition - Non-Vector Input**
Details:
  TestName: `test_non_vector_input`
  Description: Verify that when `s_vectors` contains non-vector inputs, the function raises an error.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `s_vectors` with a non-vector input (e.g., a string or integer).
  Act: Call `check_plagiarism()`.
  Assert: An error is raised (e.g., `TypeError` or `ValueError`).

Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles error conditions where the input data is invalid.

**Scenario 7: Performance - Large Input**
Details:
  TestName: `test_large_input`
  Description: Verify that the function performs efficiently with a large input dataset.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `s_vectors` with a large dataset of students and their corresponding text vectors.
  Act: Call `check_plagiarism()`.
  Assert: The function completes within a reasonable time frame (e.g., < 1 minute).

Validation:
  This test ensures that the function is scalable and can handle large input datasets efficiently.
