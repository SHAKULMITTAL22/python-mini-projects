Here are the pytest test scenarios for the `vectorize` method:

**Scenario 1: Happy Path - Vectorization of a Single Text**
Details:
  TestName: test_vectorize_single_text
  Description: Verify that the `vectorize` function correctly transforms a single text input into a TF-IDF vector.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a single text input as a list.
  Act: Call the `vectorize` function with the prepared text input.
  Assert: Check that the output is a 2D NumPy array with shape (1, n_features), where n_features is the number of unique words in the input text.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `vectorize` function behaves as expected for a typical input, which is crucial for the downstream NLP tasks.

**Scenario 2: Multiple Text Inputs**
Details:
  TestName: test_vectorize_multiple_texts
  Description: Verify that the `vectorize` function can handle multiple text inputs and returns a 2D NumPy array with the correct shape.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of multiple text inputs.
  Act: Call the `vectorize` function with the prepared text inputs.
  Assert: Check that the output is a 2D NumPy array with shape (n_samples, n_features), where n_samples is the number of input texts and n_features is the number of unique words across all inputs.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `vectorize` function can process multiple inputs, which is essential for many NLP applications.

**Scenario 3: Empty Text Input**
Details:
  TestName: test_vectorize_empty_text
  Description: Verify that the `vectorize` function returns an empty array when given an empty text input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an empty list as the text input.
  Act: Call the `vectorize` function with the prepared text input.
  Assert: Check that the output is an empty 2D NumPy array or a specific default value (e.g., `numpy.nan`).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `vectorize` function handles edge cases correctly, which is important for robustness and preventing unexpected errors.

**Scenario 4: Text Input with Stop Words**
Details:
  TestName: test_vectorize_text_with_stop_words
  Description: Verify that the `vectorize` function ignores common stop words (e.g., "the", "and", etc.) in the input text.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a text input containing stop words.
  Act: Call the `vectorize` function with the prepared text input.
  Assert: Check that the output vector does not include features corresponding to the stop words.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `vectorize` function correctly applies the TF-IDF transformation, ignoring common stop words that do not add meaningful information to the text representation.

**Scenario 5: Text Input with Punctuation**
Details:
  TestName: test_vectorize_text_with_punctuation
  Description: Verify that the `vectorize` function correctly handles text inputs containing punctuation marks.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a text input containing punctuation marks (e.g., commas, periods, etc.).
  Act: Call the `vectorize` function with the prepared text input.
  Assert: Check that the output vector includes features corresponding to the words, but not the punctuation marks.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `vectorize` function correctly preprocesses the input text, ignoring punctuation marks that do not add meaningful information to the text representation.

**Scenario 6: Text Input with Non-ASCII Characters**
Details:
  TestName: test_vectorize_text_with_non_ascii_characters
  Description: Verify that the `vectorize` function correctly handles text inputs containing non-ASCII characters (e.g., accented letters, emojis, etc.).
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a text input containing non-ASCII characters.
  Act: Call the `vectorize` function with the prepared text input.
  Assert: Check that the output vector includes features corresponding to the words, handling non-ASCII characters correctly.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `vectorize` function is Unicode-compatible and can process text inputs with diverse character sets.

**Scenario 7: Exception Handling - Non-String Input**
Details:
  TestName: test_vectorize_non_string_input
  Description: Verify that the `vectorize` function raises an exception when given a non-string input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a non-string input (e.g., an integer, a list, etc.).
  Act: Call the `vectorize` function with the prepared input.
  Assert: Check that a `TypeError` or a specific exception is raised.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `vectorize` function is robust and raises an exception when given invalid input, preventing unexpected errors or behavior.
