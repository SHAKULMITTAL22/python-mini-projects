ROOST_METHOD_HASH=Stop_eae8ac50ea
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=Stop_5fd3b06e9b

Here are the pytest test scenarios for the `Stop` method:

Scenario 1: Disabling the stop button
Details:
  TestName: test_stop_button_disabled
  Description: Verify that the stop button is disabled when the Stop function is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the tkinter GUI with the required buttons (start, stop, reset) and set the running flag to True.
  Act: Call the Stop function.
  Assert: Check that the stop button's state is 'disabled'.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the stop button is correctly disabled, preventing the user from stopping the timer again.

Scenario 2: Enabling the start button
Details:
  TestName: test_start_button_enabled
  Description: Verify that the start button is enabled when the Stop function is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the tkinter GUI with the required buttons (start, stop, reset) and set the running flag to True.
  Act: Call the Stop function.
  Assert: Check that the start button's state is 'normal'.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the start button is correctly enabled, allowing the user to start the timer again.

Scenario 3: Enabling the reset button
Details:
  TestName: test_reset_button_enabled
  Description: Verify that the reset button is enabled when the Stop function is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the tkinter GUI with the required buttons (start, stop, reset) and set the running flag to True.
  Act: Call the Stop function.
  Assert: Check that the reset button's state is 'normal'.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the reset button is correctly enabled, allowing the user to reset the timer.

Scenario 4: Setting the running flag to False
Details:
  TestName: test_running_flag_set_to_false
  Description: Verify that the running flag is set to False when the Stop function is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the tkinter GUI with the required buttons (start, stop, reset) and set the running flag to True.
  Act: Call the Stop function.
  Assert: Check that the running flag is False.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the running flag is correctly set to False, indicating that the timer has stopped.

Scenario 5: Concurrent calls to Stop
Details:
  TestName: test_concurrent_stop_calls
  Description: Verify that multiple calls to the Stop function do not cause unexpected behavior.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the tkinter GUI with the required buttons (start, stop, reset) and set the running flag to True.
  Act: Call the Stop function multiple times.
  Assert: Check that the buttons' states and the running flag remain unchanged after the second call.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the Stop function is idempotent, meaning that multiple calls have the same effect as a single call.

Scenario 6: Initial state of buttons and running flag
Details:
  TestName: test_initial_state
  Description: Verify that the buttons' states and the running flag are correctly initialized.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the tkinter GUI with the required buttons (start, stop, reset).
  Act: None (initial state).
  Assert: Check that the start button's state is 'normal', the stop button's state is 'disabled', the reset button's state is 'disabled', and the running flag is False.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the GUI is correctly initialized, and the buttons' states and the running flag are set to their default values.
