Sure, here are some test scenarios for the `judge_leap_year` function:

1. Test with a leap year:
   - Input: 2000
   - Expected Output: True
   - Reason: 2000 is a leap year because it is divisible by 4, but not by 100. However, it is divisible by 400, so it is a leap year.

2. Test with a non-leap year:
   - Input: 1900
   - Expected Output: False
   - Reason: 1900 is not a leap year because it is divisible by 4, but not by 100.

3. Test with a year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400:
   - Input: 1800
   - Expected Output: False
   - Reason: 1800 is not a leap year because it is divisible by 100 but not by 400.

4. Test with a year that is divisible by 4 but not by 100:
   - Input: 2004
   - Expected Output: True
   - Reason: 2004 is a leap year because it is divisible by 4 but not by 100.

5. Test with a year that is not divisible by 4:
   - Input: 2003
   - Expected Output: False
   - Reason: 2003 is not a leap year because it is not divisible by 4.

6. Test with a negative year:
   - Input: -400
   - Expected Output: False
   - Reason: Negative years are not considered in the Gregorian calendar.

7. Test with a zero:
   - Input: 0
   - Expected Output: False
   - Reason: The year 0 is not a valid year in the Gregorian calendar.

8. Test with a positive year:
   - Input: 400
   - Expected Output: True
   - Reason: 400 is a leap year because it is divisible by 400.

Sure, here is a pytest for the `judge_leap_year` function:

```python
import pytest
from calculate import judge_leap_year
from calendar import isleap

def test_leap_year():
    # Test with a leap year
    assert judge_leap_year(2000) == isleap(2000)

def test_non_leap_year():
    # Test with a non-leap year
    assert judge_leap_year(1900) == isleap(1900)

def test_year_divisible_by_100_not_400():
    # Test with a year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400
    assert judge_leap_year(1800) == isleap(1800)

def test_year_divisible_by_4_not_100():
    # Test with a year that is divisible by 4 but not by 100
    assert judge_leap_year(2004) == isleap(2004)

def test_year_not_divisible_by_4():
    # Test with a year that is not divisible by 4
    assert judge_leap_year(2003) == isleap(2003)

def test_negative_year():
    # Test with a negative year
    assert judge_leap_year(-400) == isleap(-400)

def test_zero_year():
    # Test with a zero
    assert judge_leap_year(0) == isleap(0)

def test_positive_year():
    # Test with a positive year
    assert judge_leap_year(400) == isleap(400)
```

This pytest suite covers all the test scenarios you provided. Each test function is a separate unit test that checks the `judge_leap_year` function with a different input. The assert statement checks if the output of the function matches the expected output. If they match, the test passes. If they don't match, the test fails.
