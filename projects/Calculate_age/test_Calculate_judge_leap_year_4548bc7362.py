"""
Scenario 1: Testing Leap Year 
Input: A year that is evenly divisible by 4, such as 2004. 
Expected Output: The function should return True as this year is a leap year. 

Scenario 2: Testing Non-Leap Year 
Input: A year that is not evenly divisible by 4, such as 2001. 
Expected Output: The function should return False as this year is not a leap year. 

Scenario 3: Testing Year Divisible by 100 but not 400
Input: A year that is evenly divisible by 100 but not by 400, such as 1700. 
Expected Output: The function should return False, even though the year is divisible by 4, it should not be considered a leap year because it is divisible by 100 but not 400. 

Scenario 4: Testing Year Divisible by 400
Input: A year that is evenly divisible by 400, such as 1600. 
Expected Output: The function should return True. While the year is a multiple of 100, it is also a multiple of 400, making it a leap year.

Scenario 5: Testing Negative Year Input
Input: A negative year number such as -1600.
Expected Output: In the Gregorian calendar, there were no negative years, so function should return False.

Scenario 6: Testing Future Leap Year
Input: A year in the future that will be a leap year such as 2040.
Expected Output: The function should return True as this will be a leap year.

Scenario 7: Testing Future Non-leap Year
Input: A year in the future that will not be a leap year such as 2041.
Expected Output: The function should return False as this will not be a leap year.
