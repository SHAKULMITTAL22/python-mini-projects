"""
To validate the business logic of the `calculate.judge_leap_year` function without writing test code or considering input data types, we can establish several test scenarios. These scenarios will consider the rules that define a leap year. Generally, the rules for a year to be a leap year are:

1. If the year is evenly divisible by 4, go to step 2. Otherwise, go to step 5.
2. If the year is evenly divisible by 100, go to step 3. Otherwise, go to step 4.
3. If the year is evenly divisible by 400, go to step 4. Otherwise, go to step 5.
4. The year is a leap year (it has 366 days).
5. The year is not a leap year (it has 365 days).

Given the above rules, here are the test scenarios:
1. **Year is evenly divisible by 4 but not by 100**: The function should return `True`. For instance, 2024 is divisible by 4 and not by 100, so it is a leap year.
2. **Year is evenly divisible by 100 but not by 400**: The function should return `False`. For instance, 1900 is divisible by 100 and not by 400, so it is not a leap year.
3. **Year is evenly divisible by 400**: The function should return `True`. For instance, 2000 is divisible by 400, and it is a leap year.
4. **Year is not evenly divisible by 4**: The function should return `False`. For example, 2019 is not divisible by 4, so it is not a leap year.
5. **Boundary test with a year just before a leap year**: For instance, 2023 is not a leap year, the function should return `False`.
6. **Boundary test with a year just after a leap year**: For instance, 2021 is not a leap year, the function should return `False`.
7. **Test with the current year** (if the current year is a leap year, function should return `True`, otherwise `False`): For example, if the current year is 2023, the function should return `False`.

Since the actual input data ranges will be provided when generating test code, the scenarios use example years to showcase the kind of inputs that would be used in the tests. It's also assumed that the `isleap` function used in the code snippet is correctly implemented, and the test scenarios are for verifying that the `judge_leap_year` function correctly interprets the result of `isleap`.
