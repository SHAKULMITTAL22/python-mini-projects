Sure, here are some test scenarios to validate the business logic of the `judge_leap_year` function:

1. **Test with a common year that is not a leap year**
   - **Scenario**: Input a year that is known not to be a leap year, such as 2001.
   - **Expected Result**: The function should return `False`.

2. **Test with a leap year divisible by 4 but not by 100**
   - **Scenario**: Input a year that is a leap year because it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, like 2024.
   - **Expected Result**: The function should return `True`.

3. **Test with a century year that is not a leap year**
   - **Scenario**: Input a century year that is not a leap year because it is not divisible by 400, such as 1900.
   - **Expected Result**: The function should return `False`.

4. **Test with a century leap year**
   - **Scenario**: Input a century year that is a leap year because it is divisible by 400, like 2000.
   - **Expected Result**: The function should return `True`.

5. **Test with a year divisible by 4 and 100 but not by 400**
   - **Scenario**: Input a year that is divisible by 4 and 100 but not by 400, such as 2100.
   - **Expected Result**: The function should return `False`.

6. **Test with the current year if it's not a leap year**
   - **Scenario**: Input the current year (assuming it's not a leap year).
   - **Expected Result**: The function should accurately return whether the current year is a leap year or not.

7. **Test with the year zero**
   - **Scenario**: Input the year zero, which is a leap year by the proleptic Gregorian calendar.
   - **Expected Result**: The function should return `True`.

8. **Test with a negative year (assuming the Gregorian calendar extends backwards)**
   - **Scenario**: Input a negative year (e.g., -4) to check if the leap year calculation is correctly applied in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.
   - **Expected Result**: The function should return `True` for -4 as it is a leap year according to the proleptic Gregorian calendar.

9. **Test with a very large leap year**
   - **Scenario**: Input a very large year that is a leap year, such as 40000.
   - **Expected Result**: The function should return `True`.

10. **Test with a very large common year**
    - **Scenario**: Input a very large year that is not a leap year, such as 40001.
    - **Expected Result**: The function should return `False`.

These scenarios cover a variety of leap year rules, including the special cases for century years and the general rule for years divisible by 4. By testing these scenarios, you should be able to validate the correctness of the `judge_leap_year` function.
