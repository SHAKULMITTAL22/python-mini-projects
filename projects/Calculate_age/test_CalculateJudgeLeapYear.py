### Test Scenarios for `judge_leap_year` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_typical_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with a known leap year, such as 2024.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `True`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's rules for leap years, which state that a year divisible by 4 is a leap year.

#### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with a known non-leap year, such as 2023.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function correctly identifies standard years that do not meet leap year conditions.

#### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 1900.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  This test is crucial because it checks the function's ability to handle exceptions in the leap year rule, specifically that most century years are not leap years unless divisible by 400.

#### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is a divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_divisible_by_400
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a leap year that is divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2000.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `True`.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly applies the leap year rule for century years divisible by 400, confirming its adherence to the complete set of rules for leap years.

#### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_future_year
  Description: Verify that the function can correctly evaluate leap years far in the future.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2400.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `True`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function remains accurate for future dates, which is important for planning and calculations in software that may run over long time periods.

#### Scenario 6: Test with the earliest year in the Gregorian calendar
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_earliest_gregorian_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles the year 1582, the first year of the Gregorian calendar.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 1582.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's accuracy at the boundary of the Gregorian calendar's introduction, ensuring historical accuracy in leap year calculation.

These scenarios collectively ensure that the `judge_leap_year` function is thoroughly tested against both typical and edge cases, confirming its reliability and correctness in identifying leap years according to the rules of the Gregorian calendar.
