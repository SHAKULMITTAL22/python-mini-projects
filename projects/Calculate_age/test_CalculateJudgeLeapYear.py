Scenario 1: Test a regular leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_regular_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a regular leap year (divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(1996)
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Regular leap years should be correctly identified as they follow the basic rule of being divisible by 4.

Scenario 2: Test a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a century leap year (divisible by 400).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2000)
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Century leap years should be correctly identified as they follow the additional rule of being divisible by 400.

Scenario 3: Test a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a non-leap year (not divisible by 4 or divisible by 100 but not by 400).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(1900)
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Non-leap years should be correctly identified as they do not meet the criteria for regular or century leap years.

Scenario 4: Test a year before the adoption of the Gregorian calendar
Details:
  TestName: test_pre_gregorian_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles years before the adoption of the Gregorian calendar (1582).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(1500)
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Years before the adoption of the Gregorian calendar should be treated as non-leap years, as the calendar rules were not yet in effect.

Scenario 5: Test a year outside the valid range
Details:
  TestName: test_out_of_range_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles a year outside the valid range (1 to 9999).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(10000)
  Assert: An exception should be raised or the function should return an appropriate value indicating an invalid year.
Validation:
  Years outside the valid range should be handled gracefully to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes.
