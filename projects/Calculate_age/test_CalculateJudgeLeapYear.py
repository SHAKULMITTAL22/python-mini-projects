Here are the pytest test scenarios for the `judge_leap_year` method:

**Scenario 1: Leap Year (Multiple of 4)**
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_year_multiple_of_4
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a leap year that is a multiple of 4.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with a year that is a multiple of 4 (e.g., 2020).
  Assert: The function returns `True`.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function adheres to the leap year rule, which states that years divisible by 4 are leap years.

**Scenario 2: Non-Leap Year (Not a Multiple of 4)**
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year_not_multiple_of_4
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a non-leap year that is not a multiple of 4.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with a year that is not a multiple of 4 (e.g., 2019).
  Assert: The function returns `False`.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles years that do not meet the leap year criteria.

**Scenario 3: Century Year (Multiple of 100, Not a Multiple of 400)**
Details:
  TestName: test_century_year_not_leap
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year (multiple of 100, not multiple of 400).
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with a century year that is not a leap year (e.g., 1900).
  Assert: The function returns `False`.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function adheres to the leap year rule, which states that century years are not leap years unless they are also multiples of 400.

**Scenario 4: Leap Century Year (Multiple of 400)**
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_century_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a leap century year (multiple of 400).
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with a leap century year (e.g., 2000).
  Assert: The function returns `True`.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles leap century years, which are multiples of 400.

These scenarios cover the expected behavior, edge cases, and error conditions of the `judge_leap_year` method, providing comprehensive test coverage for the function.
