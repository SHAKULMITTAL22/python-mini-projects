# Test generated by RoostGPT for test roost-test using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

"""
1. Scenario: Test with a year that is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 100 (for example, 2008)
   Expected Result: The function should return "True" because such years are leap years.

2. Scenario: Test with a year that is a multiple of 100 but not a multiple of 400 (for example, 2100)
   Expected Result: The function should return "False" because such years are not leap years though they are multiple of 4.

3. Scenario: Test with a year that is a multiple of 400 (for example, 2000)
   Expected Result: The function should return "True" because such years are leap years.

4. Scenario: Test with a year that is not a multiple of 4 (for example, 2001)
    Expected Result: The function should return "False" because such years are not leap years. 

5. Scenario: Test with a negative year (for example, -2000)
   Expected Result: The function should return "False" because there are no leap years before the introduction of the Gregorian calendar

6. Scenario: Test with the current year
   Expected Result: Depends on whether the current year is leap or not 

7. Scenario: Test with a future year (for example, 3000)
   Expected Result: Depends on whether that future year is leap or not 

8. Scenario: Test with the oldest year in the Gregorian calendar (for example, 1582)
   Expected Result: The function should return "False" because 1582 is not a leap year. 

9. Scenario: Test with a non-integer value (e.g., "2000", 2000.0). Python can accept these as input, but they should not be valid for determining leap years.
   Expected Result: The function would convert these to integer and then evaluate so expectation would be same as passing integer value.

10. Scenario: Test with no values passed in
    Expected Result: The function should throw a TypeError stating that it's missing a required argument.
