"""
Here are several test scenarios to validate the business logic of the `countdown` function without considering varying input data types:

1. **Zero Countdown**: Test the function with `t=0` and ensure it prints "Timer completed!" immediately without any countdown.

2. **Single Second Countdown**: Test the function with `t=1` and ensure it counts down from `00:01` to `00:00` and then prints "Timer completed!"

3. **One Minute Countdown**: Test the function with `t=60` and ensure it counts down from `01:00` to `00:00` correctly, updating the seconds every tick.

4. **Multiple Minutes Countdown**: Test with `t=300` (5 minutes) and ensure it starts at `05:00` and counts down to `00:00` correctly.

5. **Off-by-One Error**: Test the function with `t=2` to check that it doesn't stop at `00:01` but properly ends the countdown at `00:00`.

6. **Large Value Countdown**: Test the function with a very large value (e.g., `t=3600` for 1 hour) to ensure it handles large numbers correctly.

7. **Boundary Value**: Test the function with `t=59` and `t=61` to see how it transitions from minutes to seconds at the boundary of a minute.

8. **Non-Continuous Output**: Test to ensure that the function does not print out intermediate values more than once (i.e., the output "timer" is overwritten correctly).

9. **System Load**: Test the function with regular input under heavy system load to see if it still maintains accurate second intervals. This is a non-functional requirement, but important to ensure timer accuracy under different system conditions.

10. **Interrupt Scenario**: Test the function's behavior when it's interrupted (e.g., by a KeyboardInterrupt). Ideally, the function should handle interruptions gracefully.

11. **Running Multiple Instances**: Test the function by running multiple instances of the countdown in parallel to see if they run independently and do not interfere with each other's output.

12. **System Clock Change**: Change the system clock while the countdown is running to see if it impacts the countdown duration or accuracy.

13. **Long Running Timer**: Test the function with a countdown of several hours to ensure that there are no memory leaks or issues with long-running processes.

14. **Timer Accuracy**: Test the function's accuracy by comparing the countdown duration with an external timer to ensure it's counting down in real-time seconds.

These scenarios cover different aspects of functionality and help ensure that the countdown function behaves as expected in various situations.
