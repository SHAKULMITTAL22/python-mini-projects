### Test Scenarios for the `countdown` Function

#### Scenario 1: Countdown from a positive number
Details:
  TestName: test_countdown_from_positive_number
  Description: Verify that the countdown function correctly counts down from a specified positive number to zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a small positive integer, e.g., 10 seconds.
  Act: Call the countdown function with the chosen number.
  Assert: Check that the output matches the expected countdown sequence from 10 seconds to 'Timer completed!'.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the basic functionality of counting down from a positive number works as expected. The countdown should decrement the time every second and finally print 'Timer completed!'.

#### Scenario 2: Countdown from zero
Details:
  TestName: test_countdown_from_zero
  Description: Ensure that calling the countdown function with zero seconds immediately prints 'Timer completed!' without any delay.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the countdown time to 0 seconds.
  Act: Call the countdown function with 0.
  Assert: Verify that 'Timer completed!' is printed immediately.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's behavior when starting from the boundary condition of 0 seconds. The expected behavior is an immediate completion message, confirming that no countdown is needed.

#### Scenario 3: Countdown with maximum single-digit input
Details:
  TestName: test_countdown_maximum_single_digit
  Description: Test the countdown function with the maximum single-digit input (9 seconds) to ensure it handles single-digit inputs correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the countdown time to 9 seconds.
  Act: Call the countdown function with this value.
  Assert: Confirm that the countdown correctly displays each second from 9 to 0 followed by 'Timer completed!'.
Validation:
  This scenario verifies that the function can handle single-digit countdowns correctly, updating the timer every second. It ensures the format and timing are maintained even with shorter durations.

#### Scenario 4: Countdown with a non-integer value
Details:
  TestName: test_countdown_with_non_integer
  Description: Test the countdown function's response to a non-integer input, such as a float, to see if it rounds down and processes the input correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a floating-point number, e.g., 10.7 seconds.
  Act: Call the countdown function with this floating-point number.
  Assert: Check that the function rounds down and counts down from 10 seconds.
Validation:
  Although the function is expected to handle integers, this test checks its robustness when faced with a float. The expected behavior is rounding down and proceeding with the countdown, which would be a reasonable handling method for such input.

#### Scenario 5: Countdown with a large number
Details:
  TestName: test_countdown_large_number
  Description: Verify that the countdown function can handle a large input, such as several hours, without issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the countdown time to a large number, e.g., 7200 seconds (2 hours).
  Act: Call the countdown function with this large number.
  Assert: Ensure the countdown starts at the correct time and decrements correctly at least for the first few seconds (practical constraints prevent testing the entire duration).
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's capability to handle large numbers and maintain accuracy over extended periods. It's crucial for the function to be reliable with any valid integer input.

These scenarios collectively ensure that the countdown function behaves as expected across a range of typical and boundary conditions, maintaining robustness and accuracy in its operation.
