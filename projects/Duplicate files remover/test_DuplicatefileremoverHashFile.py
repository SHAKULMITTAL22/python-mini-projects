ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashFile_174ca31ff9

Scenario 1: Hash a valid file
TestName: test_hash_valid_file
Description: Verify that the hashFile function correctly generates the MD5 hash for a given valid file.
Execution:
- Arrange: Prepare a test file with known content and its pre-calculated MD5 hash.
- Act: Call the hashFile function with the test file path as the argument.
- Assert: Compare the returned hash value with the pre-calculated MD5 hash.

Validation: This test ensures that the hashFile function correctly calculates the MD5 hash for a valid file. It is essential to confirm that the function processes the file's content and generates the expected hash value.

---

Scenario 2: Hash an empty file
TestName: test_hash_empty_file
Description: Verify that the hashFile function returns an appropriate value when provided with an empty file.
Execution:
- Arrange: Create an empty file.
- Act: Call the hashFile function with the empty file path as the argument.
- Assert: Check if the returned hash value is not None or an empty string.

Validation: This test ensures that the hashFile function handles empty files gracefully and does not raise an exception or return an unexpected value.

---

Scenario 3: Handle non-existent file
TestName: test_handle_non_existent_file
Description: Verify that the hashFile function raises an appropriate exception when the provided file does not exist.
Execution:
- Arrange: Define a non-existent file path.
- Act: Call the hashFile function with the non-existent file path as the argument.
- Assert: Catch FileNotFoundError and assert that the message indicates the file was not found.

Validation: This test ensures that the hashFile function handles non-existent files by raising a FileNotFoundError, which is the expected behavior for most file operations in Python.

---

Scenario 4: Hash a large file
TestName: test_hash_large_file
Description: Verify that the hashFile function calculates the MD5 hash correctly for a large file.
Execution:
- Arrange: Prepare a large file with known content and its pre-calculated MD5 hash.
- Act: Call the hashFile function with the large file path as the argument.
- Assert: Compare the returned hash value with the pre-calculated MD5 hash.

Validation: This test ensures that the hashFile function can handle large files without consuming excessive memory, which is the primary motivation for reading the file in blocks.

---

Scenario 5: Hash a file with special characters in the name
TestName: test_hash_file_with_special_characters
Description: Verify that the hashFile function correctly generates the MD5 hash for a file with special characters in its name.
Execution:
- Arrange: Prepare a file with special characters in its name and known content, then calculate its pre-calculated MD5 hash.
- Act: Call the hashFile function with the file path, including special characters, as the argument.
- Assert: Compare the returned hash value with the pre-calculated MD5 hash.

Validation: This test ensures that the hashFile function can correctly handle file names with special characters, which might cause issues in some environments or when using different character encodings.
