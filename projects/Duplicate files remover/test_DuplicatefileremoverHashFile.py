Scenario 1: Test if hashFile generates correct MD5 hash for a given file
Details:
TestName: test_hash_file_correctly
Description: This test verifies if the hashFile function generates the correct MD5 hash for a given file.
Execution:
Arrange:
Create a temporary file with known content and calculate its MD5 hash using a third-party tool or library.
Act:
Call the hashFile function with the path to the temporary file as the argument.
Assert:
Compare the generated hash with the known MD5 hash. They should be equal.
Validation:
It's essential to test if the function correctly calculates the MD5 hash for a given file, ensuring the integrity of the file and validating the business requirement.

Scenario 2: Test if hashFile handles empty files correctly
Details:
TestName: test_hash_empty_file
Description: This test verifies if the hashFile function handles empty files correctly by returning a valid MD5 hash.
Execution:
Arrange:
Create an empty file.
Act:
Call the hashFile function with the path to the empty file as the argument.
Assert:
Check if the returned hash is a valid MD5 hash, even if the file is empty.
Validation:
An empty file should still generate a valid MD5 hash, which is important to test for edge cases and validate the function's behavior.

Scenario 3: Test if hashFile handles large files correctly
Details:
TestName: test_hash_large_file
Description: This test verifies if the hashFile function handles large files correctly by generating the correct MD5 hash without memory overflow.
Execution:
Arrange:
Create a large file (e.g., several gigabytes in size) with known content and calculate its MD5 hash using a third-party tool or library.
Act:
Call the hashFile function with the path to the large file as the argument.
Assert:
Compare the generated hash with the known MD5 hash. They should be equal.
Validation:
Handling large files is crucial to ensure the function works correctly and efficiently in various scenarios, making this test necessary to validate the business requirement.

Scenario 4: Test if hashFile raises an exception when the file does not exist
Details:
TestName: test_file_not_found_exception
Description: This test verifies if the hashFile function raises a FileNotFoundError when the specified file does not exist.
Execution:
Arrange:
Delete the temporary file created in the previous tests or use a non-existent file path.
Act:
Call the hashFile function with the non-existent file path as the argument.
Assert:
Check if the function raises a FileNotFoundError.
Validation:
It's essential to test for error conditions to ensure the function handles them correctly and provides meaningful feedback to the user or calling code.

Scenario 5: Test if hashFile handles binary and text files correctly
Details:
TestName: test_hash_binary_and_text_files
Description: This test verifies if the hashFile function generates the correct MD5 hash for both binary and text files.
Execution:
Arrange:
Create two temporary files, one binary and one text, with known content and calculate their MD5 hashes using a third-party tool or library.
Act:
Call the hashFile function with the paths to the binary and text files as arguments.
Assert:
Compare the generated hashes with the known MD5 hashes for both files. They should be equal.
Validation:
Testing for different file types is crucial to ensure the function works correctly in various scenarios, validating the business requirement.
