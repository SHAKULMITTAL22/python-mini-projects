ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashFile_174ca31ff9

Scenario 1: Test hashFile function with a valid file
Details:
TestName: test_hashFile_valid_file
Description: Verify the hashFile function generates the correct MD5 hash for a valid file.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a sample file with known content and calculate its MD5 hash using a separate tool or library.
Act: Call the hashFile function with the path to the sample file as an argument.
Assert: Compare the generated hash with the expected hash value.
Validation: This test ensures the hashFile function correctly calculates the MD5 hash for valid input files.

Scenario 2: Test hashFile function with an empty file
Details:
TestName: test_hashFile_empty_file
Description: Verify the hashFile function generates the correct MD5 hash for an empty file.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an empty file.
Act: Call the hashFile function with the path to the empty file as an argument.
Assert: Compare the generated hash with the expected hash value for an empty file (e.g., d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e).
Validation: This test ensures the hashFile function correctly calculates the MD5 hash for empty input files.

Scenario 3: Test hashFile function with a non-existent file
Details:
TestName: test_hashFile_non_existent_file
Description: Verify the hashFile function raises an exception when provided with an invalid file path.
Execution:
Arrange: Prepare a non-existent file path string.
Act: Call the hashFile function with the non-existent file path as an argument.
Assert: Catch the expected exception type (e.g., FileNotFoundError) and check if the message matches the expected error message.
Validation: This test ensures the hashFile function correctly handles non-existent file paths and raises the appropriate exception.

Scenario 4: Test hashFile function with a directory
Details:
TestName: test_hashFile_directory
Description: Verify the hashFile function raises an exception when provided with a directory path.
Execution:
Arrange: Prepare a valid directory path.
Act: Call the hashFile function with the directory path as an argument.
Assert: Catch the expected exception type (e.g., FileNotFoundError) and check if the message matches the expected error message.
Validation: This test ensures the hashFile function correctly handles directory paths and raises the appropriate exception.

Scenario 5: Test hashFile function with a large file
Details:
TestName: test_hashFile_large_file
Description: Verify the hashFile function generates the correct MD5 hash for a large file without causing a memory overflow.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a large sample file (e.g., > 1GB) with known content and calculate its MD5 hash using a separate tool or library.
Act: Call the hashFile function with the path to the large sample file as an argument.
Assert: Compare the generated hash with the expected hash value.
Validation: This test ensures the hashFile function correctly calculates the MD5 hash for large input files without causing memory issues.

Scenario 6: Test hashFile function with a binary file
Details:
TestName: test_hashFile_binary_file
Description: Verify the hashFile function generates the correct MD5 hash for a binary file.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a binary file with known content and calculate its MD5 hash using a separate tool or library.
Act: Call the hashFile function with the path to the binary file as an argument.
Assert: Compare the generated hash with the expected hash value.
Validation: This test ensures the hashFile function correctly calculates the MD5 hash for binary input files.

Scenario 7: Test hashFile function with a Unicode file
Details:
TestName: test_hashFile_unicode_file
Description: Verify the hashFile function generates the correct MD5 hash for a Unicode file.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a Unicode file with known content and calculate its MD5 hash using a separate tool or library.
Act: Call the hashFile function with the path to the Unicode file as an argument.
Assert: Compare the generated hash with the expected hash value.
Validation: This test ensures the hashFile function correctly calculates the MD5 hash for Unicode input files.
