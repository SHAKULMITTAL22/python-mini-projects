Scenario 1: Test Hashing a Small File
Details:
  TestName: test_hash_small_file
  Description: Verify that the function correctly computes the MD5 hash of a small file.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a small text file with known content, e.g., "test.txt" containing "Hello, World!"
  Act: Call `hashFile` with the filename as the argument.
  Assert: Compare the result to the precomputed MD5 hash of "Hello, World!", which is "5eb63bbbe01eeed093cb22bb8f5acdc3".
Validation:
  This test is essential for ensuring that the function correctly computes the hash of a small file, which is the most common use case.

Scenario 2: Test Hashing a Large File
Details:
  TestName: test_hash_large_file
  Description: Ensure that the function correctly computes the MD5 hash of a large file.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a large file, e.g., "large_test.txt" containing 100,000 random alphanumeric characters.
  Act: Call `hashFile` with the filename as the argument.
  Assert: Compare the result to the precomputed MD5 hash of the large file content.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for ensuring that the function correctly handles large files without memory overflow issues.

Scenario 3: Test Hashing an Empty File
Details:
  TestName: test_hash_empty_file
  Description: Verify that the function correctly computes the MD5 hash of an empty file.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty file, e.g., "empty.txt".
  Act: Call `hashFile` with the filename as the argument.
  Assert: Compare the result to the precomputed MD5 hash of an empty string, which is "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e".
Validation:
  This test is necessary for ensuring that the function correctly handles empty files.

Scenario 4: Test Hashing a Nonexistent File
Details:
  TestName: test_hash_nonexistent_file
  Description: Validate that the function correctly handles a nonexistent file by raising an appropriate exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a non-existent filename, e.g., "nonexistent.txt".
  Act: Call `hashFile` with the filename as the argument.
  Assert: Expect a `FileNotFoundError` to be raised.
Validation:
  This test is essential for ensuring that the function correctly handles nonexistent files and fails gracefully.

Scenario 5: Test Hashing a Non-ASCII File
Details:
  TestName: test_hash_non_ascii_file
  Description: Verify that the function correctly computes the MD5 hash of a file containing non-ASCII characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a file with non-ASCII content, e.g., "non_ascii.txt" containing "Hello, World! 你好，世界！".
  Act: Call `hashFile` with the filename as the argument.
  Assert: Compare the result to the precomputed MD5 hash of the non-ASCII file content.
Validation:
  This test is important for ensuring that the function correctly handles non-ASCII characters and supports various character encodings.

Scenario 6: Test Hashing a File with Different Block Sizes
Details:
  TestName: test_hash_file_with_different_block_sizes
  Description: Ensure that the function correctly computes the MD5 hash of a file with different block sizes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create files with different block sizes, e.g., "block_32k.txt" and "block_128k.txt".
  Act: Call `hashFile` with the filenames as arguments.
  Assert: Compare the results to the precomputed MD5 hashes of the file content with different block sizes.
Validation:
  This test is necessary for ensuring that the function correctly computes the hash regardless of the block size used.
