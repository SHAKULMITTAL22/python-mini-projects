ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashFile_174ca31ff9

Scenario 1: Test hashFile with a valid file
Details:
TestName: test_hashFile_valid_file
Description: Verify the hashFile function correctly generates an MD5 hash for a valid file.
Execution:
Arrange:
- Create a test file with some content.
- Import the hashFile function.
Act:
- Call the hashFile function with the test file as a parameter.
Assert:
- Check that the returned hash is a string.
- Compare the calculated hash to a precomputed hash of the test file.
Validation:
- This test is important to ensure that the hashFile function can accurately generate a hash for a valid file, which is its primary purpose.

Scenario 2: Test hashFile with an empty file
Details:
TestName: test_hashFile_empty_file
Description: Verify the hashFile function correctly generates an MD5 hash for an empty file.
Execution:
Arrange:
- Create an empty test file.
- Import the hashFile function.
Act:
- Call the hashFile function with the empty test file as a parameter.
Assert:
- Check that the returned hash is a string.
- Compare the calculated hash to a precomputed hash of an empty file.
Validation:
- This test is important to ensure that the hashFile function can handle empty files and generate an appropriate hash.

Scenario 3: Test hashFile with a non-existent file
Details:
TestName: test_hashFile_non_existent_file
Description: Verify the hashFile function raises a FileNotFoundError when the specified file does not exist.
Execution:
Arrange:
- Do not create a test file.
- Import the hashFile function.
Act:
- Call the hashFile function with a non-existent file path.
Assert:
- Catch the FileNotFoundError and verify it is raised.
Validation:
- This test is important to ensure that the hashFile function handles file access errors gracefully and that the error is passed on to the caller.

Scenario 4: Test hashFile with a large file
Details:
TestName: test_hashFile_large_file
Description: Verify the hashFile function correctly generates an MD5 hash for a large file without consuming excessive memory.
Execution:
Arrange:
- Create a large test file (e.g., several GB in size).
- Import the hashFile function.
Act:
- Call the hashFile function with the large test file as a parameter.
Assert:
- Check that the returned hash is a string.
- Compare the calculated hash to a precomputed hash of the large test file.
Validation:
- This test is important to ensure that the hashFile function can handle large files efficiently and without causing memory issues.

Scenario 5: Test hashFile with a file containing Unicode characters
Details:
TestName: test_hashFile_unicode_file
Description: Verify the hashFile function correctly generates an MD5 hash for a file containing Unicode characters.
Execution:
Arrange:
- Create a test file with Unicode characters.
- Import the hashFile function.
Act:
- Call the hashFile function with the test file containing Unicode characters as a parameter.
Assert:
- Check that the returned hash is a string.
- Compare the calculated hash to a precomputed hash of the test file with Unicode characters.
Validation:
- This test is important to ensure that the hashFile function can handle files containing Unicode characters and generate an accurate hash.
