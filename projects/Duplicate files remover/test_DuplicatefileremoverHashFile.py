Scenario 1: Validate MD5 hash for a small text file
Details:
  TestName: test_small_text_file_hash
  Description: Verifies that the hashFile function correctly calculates the MD5 hash for a small text file.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a small text file with a known content and calculate its MD5 hash using a trusted external tool.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the path to the created text file as an argument.
  Assert: Check if the returned hash matches the expected hash calculated externally.
Validation:
  This test is essential to ensure the correct implementation of the MD5 hash calculation for small text files, which is a common use case.

Scenario 2: Validate MD5 hash for a large binary file
Details:
  TestName: test_large_binary_file_hash
  Description: Verifies that the hashFile function correctly calculates the MD5 hash for a large binary file.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a large binary file with known content and calculate its MD5 hash using a trusted external tool.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the path to the created binary file as an argument.
  Assert: Check if the returned hash matches the expected hash calculated externally.
Validation:
  This test is essential to ensure the correct implementation of the MD5 hash calculation for large binary files, which is another common use case.

Scenario 3: Validate MD5 hash for an empty file
Details:
  TestName: test_empty_file_hash
  Description: Verifies that the hashFile function correctly calculates the MD5 hash for an empty file.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty file.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the path to the empty file as an argument.
  Assert: Check if the returned hash is equal to the MD5 hash of an empty string.
Validation:
  This test is essential to ensure the correct implementation of the MD5 hash calculation for empty files, which may occur in certain situations.

Scenario 4: Validate MD5 hash for a non-existent file
Details:
  TestName: test_non_existent_file_hash
  Description: Verifies that the hashFile function raises a FileNotFoundError when the provided file path does not exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a non-existent file path.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the non-existent file path as an argument.
  Assert: Catch the FileNotFoundError exception and check if it is raised.
Validation:
  This test is essential to ensure the function's behavior is well-defined when handling non-existent files, which may occur due to user error or system issues.

Scenario 5: Validate MD5 hash for a directory
Details:
  TestName: test_directory_hash
  Description: Verifies that the hashFile function raises a FileNotFoundError when the provided path is a directory.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an existing directory path.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the directory path as an argument.
  Assert: Catch the FileNotFoundError exception and check if it is raised.
Validation:
  This test is essential to ensure the function's behavior is well-defined when handling directories, which should not be treated as files.
