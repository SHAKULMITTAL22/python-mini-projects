ROOST_METHOD_HASH=hashFile_63b65f43a2
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashFile_174ca31ff9

Scenario 1: Test Hashing a File with Content
Details:
  TestName: test_hashFile_with_file_content
  Description: Verifies that the function calculates the correct MD5 hash for a file with content.

Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a test file with a known content, e.g., "test content".
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the test file name as a parameter: `hash = hashFile("test_file.txt")`.
  Assert: Check if the returned hash value matches the expected hash value, which can be calculated using an online MD5 hash generator or a separate Python script.

Validation:
  This test is essential to ensure that the hashFile function correctly calculates the MD5 hash for files with content. It helps verify the function's primary functionality and its ability to process files with valid content.

---

Scenario 2: Test Hashing an Empty File
Details:
  TestName: test_hashFile_with_empty_file
  Description: Verifies that the function calculates the correct MD5 hash for an empty file.

Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an empty test file.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the empty test file name as a parameter: `hash = hashFile("empty_test_file.txt")`.
  Assert: Check if the returned hash value matches the expected hash value for an empty file, which should be a specific string.

Validation:
  This test validates the function's behavior when handling empty files. It ensures that the function can correctly calculate the MD5 hash for files with no content.

---

Scenario 3: Test Hashing a Non-existent File
Details:
  TestName: test_hashFile_with_non_existent_file
  Description: Verifies that the function raises an exception when attempting to hash a non-existent file.

Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure that the test file does not exist in the file system.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the non-existent test file name as a parameter: `hash = hashFile("non_existent_test_file.txt")`.
  Assert: Check if the function raises a FileNotFoundError or a similar exception.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles non-existent files by raising an appropriate exception. It validates the function's robustness and its ability to handle error conditions.

---

Scenario 4: Test Hashing a Large File
Details:
  TestName: test_hashFile_with_large_file
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly calculates the MD5 hash for a large file without causing a memory overflow.

Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a large test file, e.g., 1 GB in size.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the large test file name as a parameter: `hash = hashFile("large_test_file.bin")`.
  Assert: Check if the returned hash value matches the expected hash value, which can be calculated using an online MD5 hash generator or a separate Python script.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can correctly calculate the MD5 hash for large files without causing a memory overflow. It validates the function's performance and efficiency when handling large files.

---

Scenario 5: Test Hashing a File with Unicode Characters
Details:
  TestName: test_hashFile_with_unicode_file
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly calculates the MD5 hash for a file with Unicode characters in its name.

Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a test file with Unicode characters in its name, e.g., "test_日本語.txt".
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the test file name as a parameter: `hash = hashFile("test_日本語.txt")`.
  Assert: Check if the returned hash value matches the expected hash value, which can be calculated using an online MD5 hash generator or a separate Python script.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can correctly calculate the MD5 hash for files with Unicode characters in their names. It validates the function's compatibility with various file naming conventions.

# ********RoostGPT********
1. The first issue is the import statement for the `hashlib` module. It should be `import hashlib` instead of `from hashlib import md5`.
2. The `pytest` module is not imported in the code, which is causing the NameError. I have added the import statement for `pytest`.
3. I have also added a missing `import os` statement, which is required for the `os.urandom` function call.
4. I have added comments to explain the purpose of each test case and the changes made.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import os
import hashlib
from duplicatefileremover import hashFile
import pytest

class Test_DuplicatefileremoverHashFile:
    @pytest.mark.smoke
    @pytest.mark.valid
    def test_hashFile_with_file_content(self):
        # Arrange
        test_content = "test content"
        test_file = "test_file.txt"
        with open(test_file, "w") as f:
            f.write(test_content)

        # Act
        hash = hashFile(test_file)

        # Assert
        expected_hash = hashlib.md5(test_content.encode()).hexdigest()
        assert hash == expected_hash

        # Clean up
        os.remove(test_file)

    @pytest.mark.smoke
    @pytest.mark.valid
    def test_hashFile_with_empty_file(self):
        # Arrange
        test_file = "empty_test_file.txt"
        open(test_file, "a").close()

        # Act
        hash = hashFile(test_file)

        # Assert
        expected_hash = hashlib.md5("".encode()).hexdigest()
        assert hash == expected_hash

        # Clean up
        os.remove(test_file)
