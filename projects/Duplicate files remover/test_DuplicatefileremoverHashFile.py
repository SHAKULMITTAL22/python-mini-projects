ROOST_METHOD_HASH=hashFile_63b65f43a2
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashFile_174ca31ff9

Scenario 1: Test hashFile function with a valid file
Details:
  TestName: test_hashfile_valid_file
  Description: This test verifies the hashFile function's ability to generate a correct hash for a given valid file.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a test file with known content.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the test file's path as an argument.
  Assert: Check if the returned hash matches the expected hash value for the test file's content.
Validation:
  This test is critical to ensure that the hashFile function generates correct hash values for valid files, which is the primary functionality of this function.

Scenario 2: Test hashFile function with an empty file
Details:
  TestName: test_hashfile_empty_file
  Description: This test verifies the hashFile function's behavior when an empty file is provided as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty test file.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the empty test file's path as an argument.
  Assert: Check if the returned hash is equal to the hash value for an empty file.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the hashFile function handles empty files correctly, ensuring consistent behavior across various input scenarios.

Scenario 3: Test hashFile function with a non-existent file
Details:
  TestName: test_hashfile_nonexistent_file
  Description: This test verifies the hashFile function's behavior when a non-existent file is provided as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not create a test file.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with a non-existent file's path as an argument.
  Assert: Check if the function raises an appropriate exception (e.g., FileNotFoundError).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashFile function handles non-existent files gracefully, providing meaningful feedback to the caller.

Scenario 4: Test hashFile function with a large file
Details:
  TestName: test_hashfile_large_file
  Description: This test verifies the hashFile function's performance and correctness when handling large files.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a large test file with known content.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the large test file's path as an argument.
  Assert: Check if the returned hash matches the expected hash value for the large test file's content within a reasonable timeframe.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the hashFile function can handle large files efficiently, maintaining both performance and correctness.

Scenario 5: Test hashFile function with a file of different encoding
Details:
  TestName: test_hashfile_different_encoding
  Description: This test verifies the hashFile function's ability to generate the correct hash for a file with a different encoding.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a test file with known content and a different encoding (e.g., UTF-16).
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the test file's path and encoding as arguments.
  Assert: Check if the returned hash matches the expected hash value for the test file's content.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashFile function can handle files with different encodings, providing consistent and accurate results.

Scenario 6: Test hashFile function with a null input
Details:
  TestName: test_hashfile_null_input
  Description: This test verifies the hashFile function's behavior when a null input is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not pass any input to the hashFile function.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with no arguments.
  Assert: Check if the function raises an appropriate exception (e.g., TypeError).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashFile function handles null inputs gracefully, providing meaningful feedback to the caller.
