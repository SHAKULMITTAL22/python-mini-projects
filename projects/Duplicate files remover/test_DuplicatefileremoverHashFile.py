Scenario 1: Test valid hash generation for an existing file
Details:
  TestName: test_hash_file_valid
  Description: Verify that the function correctly generates a hash for an existing file.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a test file with a known content (e.g., "test_content.txt" with content "Test content")
  Act:
    - Call `hashFile` function with the test file as an argument (e.g., `hashFile("test_content.txt")`)
  Assert:
    - Check if the returned hash is equal to the expected hash value (e.g., "5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99")
Validation:
  Ensuring the correct hash generation for existing files is crucial for the function's intended purpose. This test validates that the function can read a file, compute its hash, and return the correct value.

Scenario 2: Test hash generation for an empty file
Details:
  TestName: test_hash_file_empty
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when generating a hash for an empty file.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create an empty test file (e.g., "empty_file.txt")
  Act:
    - Call `hashFile` function with the empty test file as an argument (e.g., `hashFile("empty_file.txt")`)
  Assert:
    - Check if the returned hash is equal to the expected hash value for an empty file (e.g., "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e")
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle empty files gracefully and generate the correct hash value.

Scenario 3: Test hash generation for a non-existent file
Details:
  TestName: test_hash_file_non_existent
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when handling non-existent files.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Ensure there is no file with the provided name in the current directory (e.g., "non_existent_file.txt")
  Act:
    - Call `hashFile` function with the non-existent file as an argument (e.g., `hashFile("non_existent_file.txt")`)
  Assert:
    - Check if the function raises a `FileNotFoundError`
Validation:
  This test validates the function's error handling when dealing with non-existent files, ensuring that it fails gracefully and raises the appropriate exception.

Scenario 4: Test hash generation performance for large files
Details:
  TestName: test_hash_file_large_file
  Description: Verify the function's performance when generating a hash for a large file.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a large test file (e.g., 1 GB) with known content (e.g., "large_file.txt")
  Act:
    - Call `hashFile` function with the large test file as an argument (e.g., `hashFile("large_file.txt")`)
  Assert:
    - Measure the time taken to generate the hash and ensure it is within an acceptable range (e.g., less than 30 seconds)
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can efficiently handle large files and generate hashes within a reasonable time frame.

Scenario 5: Test hash generation for a file with varying block sizes
Details:
  TestName: test_hash_file_varying_block_sizes
  Description: Verify the function's hash generation consistency with varying block sizes.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a test file with known content (e.g., "test_content.txt" with content "Test content")
  Act:
    - Call `hashFile` function with the test file and varying block sizes (e.g., 4096, 8192, and 16384).
  Assert:
    - Check if the returned hash values are the same for all block sizes.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function's hash generation is consistent regardless of the block size used during computation.

Scenario 6: Test hash generation for a file with different encoding
Details:
  TestName: test_hash_file_different_encoding
  Description: Verify the function's hash generation consistency with different file encodings.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a test file with known content and a specific encoding (e.g., "test_content_utf8.txt" with content "Test content" in UTF-8)
  Act:
    - Call `hashFile` function with the test file and different encodings (e.g., UTF-8, UTF-16, and ASCII).
  Assert:
    - Check if the returned hash values are the same for all encodings.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function's hash generation is consistent regardless of the file encoding used during computation.
