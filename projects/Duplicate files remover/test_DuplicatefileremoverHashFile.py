ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashFile_174ca31ff9

Scenario 1: Test if the hashFile function returns the correct MD5 hash for a small file
Details:
  TestName: test_hashfile_small_file
  Description: This test verifies that the hashFile function correctly calculates the MD5 hash for a small file.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a small text file with known content and calculate its MD5 hash using a trusted tool.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the filename as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hash value matches the expected hash value.
Validation:
  This test is essential to verify that the hashFile function can correctly calculate the MD5 hash for small files, ensuring the correctness of the function's implementation.

Scenario 2: Test if the hashFile function returns the correct MD5 hash for a large file
Details:
  TestName: test_hashfile_large_file
  Description: This test verifies that the hashFile function correctly calculates the MD5 hash for a large file.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a large file with known content and calculate its MD5 hash using a trusted tool.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the filename as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hash value matches the expected hash value.
Validation:
  This test is essential to verify that the hashFile function can correctly calculate the MD5 hash for large files, ensuring the correctness of the function's implementation.

Scenario 3: Test if the hashFile function handles non-existent files
Details:
  TestName: test_hashfile_non_existent_file
  Description: This test verifies that the hashFile function handles non-existent files gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Pass a non-existent filename as a parameter to the hashFile function.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the non-existent filename as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the function raises a FileNotFoundError.
Validation:
  This test is essential to verify that the hashFile function handles non-existent files correctly, ensuring that the function does not cause unexpected crashes or errors.

Scenario 4: Test if the hashFile function handles files with zero length
Details:
  TestName: test_hashfile_zero_length_file
  Description: This test verifies that the hashFile function handles files with zero length correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a file with zero length.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the filename as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns a specific hash value for an empty file, e.g., 'd41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e'.
Validation:
  This test is essential to verify that the hashFile function handles files with zero length correctly, ensuring that the function does not cause unexpected crashes or errors.

Scenario 5: Test if the hashFile function handles files with different block sizes
Details:
  TestName: test_hashfile_different_block_sizes
  Description: This test verifies that the hashFile function calculates the same MD5 hash regardless of the block size used.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a file with known content and calculate its MD5 hash using a trusted tool. Then, calculate the MD5 hash using the hashFile function with different block sizes.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the filename as a parameter and different block sizes.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hash value matches the expected hash value for all block sizes.
Validation:
  This test is essential to verify that the hashFile function calculates the MD5 hash correctly regardless of the block size used, ensuring the correctness and consistency of the function's implementation.

Scenario 6: Test if the hashFile function handles files with different line endings
Details:
  TestName: test_hashfile_different_line_endings
  Description: This test verifies that the hashFile function calculates the same MD5 hash regardless of the line endings used.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a file with known content and different line endings (Unix-style and Windows-style). Calculate the MD5 hash using a trusted tool for each file.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with each filename as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hash value matches the expected hash value for all line endings.
Validation:
  This test is essential to verify that the hashFile function calculates the MD5 hash correctly regardless of the line endings used, ensuring the correctness and consistency of the function's implementation.
