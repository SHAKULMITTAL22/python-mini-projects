ROOST_METHOD_HASH=hashFile_63b65f43a2
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashFile_174ca31ff9

Scenario 1: Test if the function correctly calculates the hash of a small file
Details:
  TestName: test_hash_file_small
  Description: Verifies the function can correctly generate the hash of a small file by comparing the calculated hash with a predefined hash value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a small file with known content and a predefined hash value.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the filename as the argument.
  Assert: Assert the calculated hash value matches the predefined hash value.
Validation:
  It's crucial to test the basic functionality of the hashFile function with a small file, ensuring it correctly computes the hash value.

Scenario 2: Test if the function correctly calculates the hash of a large file
Details:
  TestName: test_hash_file_large
  Description: Verifies the function can correctly generate the hash of a large file by comparing the calculated hash with a predefined hash value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a large file with known content and a predefined hash value.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the filename as the argument.
  Assert: Assert the calculated hash value matches the predefined hash value.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle large files without running into memory issues by correctly calculating the hash value.

Scenario 3: Test if the function returns the correct hash type
Details:
  TestName: test_hash_type_md5
  Description: Verifies the function returns the hash value in the correct format (MD5).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a file with known content.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the filename as the argument.
  Assert: Assert the returned hash value is a string and matches the regular expression for an MD5 hash.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function returns the hash value in the expected format (MD5).

Scenario 4: Test if the function raises an exception when the file does not exist
Details:
  TestName: test_file_not_exists
  Description: Verifies the function raises a FileNotFoundError when the specified file does not exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Remove or rename the file used in the test.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the filename as the argument.
  Assert: Assert the function raises a FileNotFoundError.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles non-existent files, providing a clear error message for the user.

Scenario 5: Test if the function returns the same hash value for the same file content
Details:
  TestName: test_same_content_same_hash
  Description: Verifies the function returns the same hash value for files with the same content.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two files with the same content.
  Act: Call the hashFile function for both files.
  Assert: Assert the calculated hash values are the same for both files.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly calculates the hash value based on file content, regardless of the file name or location.

Scenario 6: Test if the function returns different hash values for different file content
Details:
  TestName: test_different_content_different_hash
  Description: Verifies the function returns different hash values for files with different content.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two files with different content.
  Act: Call the hashFile function for both files.
  Assert: Assert the calculated hash values are different for both files.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly distinguishes files with different content by returning different hash values.
