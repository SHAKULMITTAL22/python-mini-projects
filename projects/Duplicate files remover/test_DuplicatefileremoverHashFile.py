Scenario 1: Testing the Correct Hash Generation for a Small File
Details:
  TestName: test_hash_small_file
  Description: Verify that the function correctly generates an MD5 hash for a small file.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a small text file with known content.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the filename.
  Assert: The returned hash should match the expected hash for the known content.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly calculates the MD5 hash for a small file, which is an essential aspect of the function's purpose.

Scenario 2: Testing the Hash Generation for a Large File
Details:
  TestName: test_hash_large_file
  Description: Verify that the function correctly generates an MD5 hash for a large file without running into memory issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a large file with known content.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the filename.
  Assert: The returned hash should match the expected hash for the known content.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can correctly handle large files without running into memory issues, which is crucial for handling various file sizes.

Scenario 3: Testing the Hash Generation for an Empty File
Details:
  TestName: test_hash_empty_file
  Description: Verify that the function correctly generates an MD5 hash for an empty file.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty file.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the filename.
  Assert: The returned hash should match the expected hash for an empty file.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can correctly handle empty files, which is an edge case that might occur in practice.

Scenario 4: Testing the Function with a Non-Existent File
Details:
  TestName: test_hash_nonexistent_file
  Description: Verify that the function handles a non-existent file gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a non-existent file path.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the non-existent filename.
  Assert: The function should raise a FileNotFoundException.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle non-existent files and raise the appropriate exception, which is essential for handling unexpected input.

Scenario 5: Testing the Hash Generation for a File with Unicode Characters
Details:
  TestName: test_hash_unicode_file
  Description: Verify that the function correctly generates an MD5 hash for a file containing Unicode characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a file with known content, including Unicode characters.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the filename.
  Assert: The returned hash should match the expected hash for the known content with Unicode characters.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can correctly handle files containing Unicode characters, which is an aspect of the function's behavior that might be important in international contexts.
