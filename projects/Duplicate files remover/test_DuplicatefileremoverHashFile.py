ROOST_METHOD_HASH=hashFile_63b65f43a2
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashFile_174ca31ff9

Scenario 1: Test hashFile with a valid file
Details:
  TestName: test_hashFile_valid_file
  Description: Verify that hashFile correctly generates a hash for a valid file.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a temporary file with known content.
  Act: Call hashFile with the temporary file as the argument.
  Assert: Check that the returned hash is correct for the file content.
Validation:
  This test validates that hashFile can process a valid file and generate the correct hash for it. This is an essential function of the method, ensuring that files can be accurately hashed.

Scenario 2: Test hashFile with an empty file
Details:
  TestName: test_hashFile_empty_file
  Description: Verify that hashFile correctly handles an empty file.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty temporary file.
  Act: Call hashFile with the empty file as the argument.
  Assert: Check that the returned hash is as expected for an empty file.
Validation:
  This test ensures that hashFile can handle empty files without raising exceptions or producing incorrect results. It is an edge case that should be handled correctly by the method.

Scenario 3: Test hashFile with a large file
Details:
  TestName: test_hashFile_large_file
  Description: Verify that hashFile correctly generates a hash for a large file without running into memory issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a temporary file with a size close to or exceeding the system's memory limit.
  Act: Call hashFile with the large file as the argument.
  Assert: Check that the returned hash is correct for the file content.
Validation:
  This test validates that hashFile can process large files without running into memory issues, which is crucial for handling large datasets. It ensures that the method can handle real-world scenarios effectively.

Scenario 4: Test hashFile with a non-existent file
Details:
  TestName: test_hashFile_non_existent_file
  Description: Verify that hashFile correctly handles a non-existent file by raising an appropriate exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Remove the temporary file used in the previous tests or use a non-existent file path.
  Act: Call hashFile with the non-existent file as the argument.
  Assert: Check that a FileNotFoundError is raised.
Validation:
  This test ensures that hashFile correctly handles non-existent files by raising an appropriate exception. It validates the method's error handling capabilities, which is essential for robust software development.

Scenario 5: Test hashFile with a file that cannot be read
Details:
  TestName: test_hashFile_unreadable_file
  Description: Verify that hashFile correctly handles a file that cannot be read by raising an appropriate exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Change the permissions of the temporary file to make it unreadable.
  Act: Call hashFile with the unreadable file as the argument.
  Assert: Check that a PermissionError is raised.
Validation:
  This test ensures that hashFile correctly handles files that cannot be read by raising an appropriate exception. It validates the method's error handling capabilities, which is essential for robust software development.

Scenario 6: Test hashFile with a file with different block sizes
Details:
  TestName: test_hashFile_different_block_sizes
  Description: Verify that hashFile generates the same hash for a file regardless of the block size used.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a temporary file with known content.
  Act: Call hashFile with the temporary file as the argument, using different block sizes.
  Assert: Check that the returned hash is the same for all block sizes.
Validation:
  This test validates that hashFile's block size parameter does not affect the resulting hash. It ensures that the method can handle different block sizes consistently, which is important for its flexibility and reliability.
