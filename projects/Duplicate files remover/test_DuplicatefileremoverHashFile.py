ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashFile_174ca31ff9

Scenario 1: Test with an existing valid file
Scenario 2: Test with an empty file
Scenario 3: Test with a non-existent file
Scenario 4: Test with a large file to ensure memory efficiency
Scenario 5: Test with different file types (text, binary, etc.)
Scenario 6: Test with Unicode characters in the file path
Scenario 7: Test the consistency of the hash value with the same input file

Scenario 1: Test with an existing valid file
Details:
  TestName: test_hashFile_with_existing_valid_file
  Description: Verify that the function correctly calculates the hash of an existing, valid file.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a valid file for testing, such as a text file with known content.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the prepared file as an input.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hash value matches the expected value based on the file content.
Validation:
  This test is essential to ensure the function correctly calculates the hash of a valid file, which is the primary purpose of this function.

Scenario 2: Test with an empty file
Details:
  TestName: test_hashFile_with_empty_file
  Description: Verify that the function correctly calculates the hash of an empty file.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty file for testing.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the empty file as an input.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hash value matches the expected value for an empty file.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle edge cases, such as empty files, and still produce a valid hash value.

Scenario 3: Test with a non-existent file
Details:
  TestName: test_hashFile_with_non_existent_file
  Description: Verify that the function handles a non-existent file gracefully without raising an exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a non-existent file path for testing.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the non-existent file path as an input.
  Assert: Assert that the function handles the situation without raising an exception.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle errors and unexpected inputs gracefully, which is crucial for robustness and user experience.

Scenario 4: Test with a large file to ensure memory efficiency
Details:
  TestName: test_hashFile_with_large_file
  Description: Verify that the function calculates the hash of a large file without causing memory overflow.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a large file for testing, such as a file of several gigabytes in size.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the large file as an input.
  Assert: Assert that the function calculates the hash without causing a memory overflow error.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure the function's memory efficiency when handling large files, which is one of the main concerns addressed by the implementation.

Scenario 5: Test with different file types (text, binary, etc.)
Details:
  TestName: test_hashFile_with_different_file_types
  Description: Verify that the function calculates the hash correctly for different file types.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare various file types for testing, including text, binary, and compressed files.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with each file type as an input.
  Assert: Assert that the function calculates the hash correctly for each file type.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle various file types, which is important for versatility and compatibility.

Scenario 6: Test with Unicode characters in the file path
Details:
  TestName: test_hashFile_with_unicode_file_path
  Description: Verify that the function correctly calculates the hash of a file with Unicode characters in the file path.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a file with Unicode characters in the file path for testing.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the file as an input.
  Assert: Assert that the function calculates the hash correctly.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle Unicode characters in the file path, which is important for internationalization and compatibility.

Scenario 7: Test the consistency of the hash value with the same input file
Details:
  TestName: test_hashFile_consistency_with_same_input_file
  Description: Verify that the function consistently produces the same hash value for the same input file.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a file for testing.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the file as an input multiple times.
  Assert: Assert that the function produces the same hash value for each call.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function produces consistent results for the same input, which is a fundamental requirement for any hashing algorithm.
