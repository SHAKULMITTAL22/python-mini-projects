ROOST_METHOD_HASH=hashFile_63b65f43a2
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashFile_174ca31ff9

Scenario 1: Validating the MD5 hash of a given file
Details:
  TestName: test_hashFile_valid_file
  Description: This test checks if the hashFile function generates the correct MD5 hash for a given file.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a temporary file with known content and calculate its expected MD5 hash.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the temporary file's path.
  Assert: Compare the output of the hashFile function with the expected MD5 hash.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashFile function correctly calculates the MD5 hash of a file, which is essential for verifying the integrity of the file.

---

Scenario 2: Testing the function with an empty file
Details:
  TestName: test_hashFile_empty_file
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the hashFile function when an empty file is provided.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a temporary empty file.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the empty file's path.
  Assert: Check if the function returns the correct MD5 hash for an empty file (d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e).

Validation:
  This test verifies that the hashFile function handles empty files correctly, ensuring consistency in handling different file sizes.

---

Scenario 3: Testing the function with a non-existent file
Details:
  TestName: test_hashFile_non_existent_file
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the hashFile function when a non-existent file is provided.

Execution:
  Arrange: Use a non-existent file path for testing.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the non-existent file's path.
  Assert: Catch the FileNotFoundError and validate the error message.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashFile function correctly handles non-existent files by raising a FileNotFoundError, which is essential for proper error handling and robustness.

---

Scenario 4: Testing the function with a large file
Details:
  TestName: test_hashFile_large_file
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the hashFile function when a large file is provided.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a temporary large file (e.g., > 1 GB) with known content and calculate its expected MD5 hash.
  Act: Call the hashFile function with the large file's path.
  Assert: Compare the output of the hashFile function with the expected MD5 hash.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashFile function correctly calculates the MD5 hash of a large file without running into memory issues, which is essential for handling various file sizes in real-world scenarios.
