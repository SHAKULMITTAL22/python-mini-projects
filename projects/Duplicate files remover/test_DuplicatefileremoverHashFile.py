ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashFile_174ca31ff9

Scenario 1: Testing the correct hash generation for a small file
Details:
TestName: test_hash_file_small_file
Description: This test validates if the hashFile function generates the correct MD5 hash for a small file.
Execution:
Arrange: Prepare a small file with known content and its corresponding MD5 hash.
Act: Call the hashFile function with the filename as a parameter.
Assert: Compare the generated hash with the expected hash.
Validation: Ensuring the correct hash generation for small files is essential to verify the function's basic functionality and accuracy.

Scenario 2: Testing the hash generation for a large file
Details:
TestName: test_hash_file_large_file
Description: This test verifies if the hashFile function generates the correct MD5 hash for a large file without causing memory overflow.
Execution:
Arrange: Prepare a large file with known content and its corresponding MD5 hash.
Act: Call the hashFile function with the filename as a parameter.
Assert: Compare the generated hash with the expected hash.
Validation: Testing large files is crucial to ensure the function can handle varying file sizes and prevent memory overflows.

Scenario 3: Testing the hash generation with a non-existent file
Details:
TestName: test_hash_file_non_existent_file
Description: This test checks if the function handles non-existent files correctly and raises the appropriate exception.
Execution:
Arrange: Use a non-existent filename as a parameter.
Act: Call the hashFile function with the non-existent filename.
Assert: Ensure the function raises a FileNotFoundError.
Validation: Verifying error handling for non-existent files is necessary to maintain robustness and prevent unexpected behavior.

Scenario 4: Testing the hash generation with an empty file
Details:
TestName: test_hash_file_empty_file
Description: This test confirms if the hashFile function generates the correct MD5 hash for an empty file.
Execution:
Arrange: Prepare an empty file.
Act: Call the hashFile function with the empty filename as a parameter.
Assert: Ensure the generated hash matches the expected hash for an empty file.
Validation: Testing empty files helps ensure the function's correct behavior for different file types and contents.

Scenario 5: Testing the hash generation with a directory
Details:
TestName: test_hash_file_directory
Description: This test checks if the function handles directories correctly and raises the appropriate exception.
Execution:
Arrange: Use a directory path as a parameter.
Act: Call the hashFile function with the directory path as a parameter.
Assert: Ensure the function raises an IsADirectoryError.
Validation: Verifying error handling for directories contributes to the function's robustness and prevents unexpected behavior.
