================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure SMTP Authentication
Issue: The code uses plaintext authentication for SMTP, which can be intercepted and lead to account compromise.
Solution: Use OAuth2 or other secure authentication methods, or encrypt the email and password before sending them over the network.

Vulnerability: Missing SSL/TLS Certificate Validation
Issue: The code does not validate the SSL/TLS certificate for the SMTP server, exposing it to man-in-the-middle attacks.
Solution: Use a library, like `ssl`, to validate the certificate or pin the certificate to ensure it has not been tampered with.

Vulnerability: Insecure CSV File Processing
Issue: The code reads a CSV file without proper input validation, which can lead to security vulnerabilities such as CSV injection.
Solution: Sanitize the input, use a library that supports safe CSV parsing, or implement a robust CSV parser to avoid potential security issues.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful login with valid credentials
Details:
  TestName: test_login_with_valid_credentials
  Description: Verify that the login function successfully logs in when provided with a valid email address and password.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a valid email address and password
    - Initialize the SMTP server (s) with a valid host and port
  Act:
    - Call the login function with the valid email address, password, and SMTP server object
  Assert:
    - Check that the login function does not raise any exceptions
    - Verify that the SMTP server's login method is called with the correct email address and password
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the login function works as expected with valid inputs, which is the primary use case for this function.

Scenario 2: Failed login with invalid credentials
Details:
  TestName: test_login_with_invalid_credentials
  Description: Verify that the login function fails to log in when provided with an invalid email address or password.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up an invalid email address or password
    - Initialize the SMTP server (s) with a valid host and port
  Act:
    - Call the login function with the invalid email address, password, and SMTP server object
  Assert:
    - Check that the login function raises an SMTPAuthenticationError or a similar authentication-related exception
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the login function handles invalid inputs correctly, preventing unauthorized access and providing appropriate feedback to users.

Scenario 3: SMTP server initialization failure
Details:
  TestName: test_login_with_failed_smtp_initialization
  Description: Verify that the login function handles SMTP server initialization failures gracefully and raises an appropriate exception.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a valid email address and password
    - Initialize the SMTP server (s) with an invalid host or port, causing it to fail
  Act:
    - Call the login function with the valid email address, password, and SMTP server object
  Assert:
    - Check that the login function raises a ConnectionRefusedError, SMTPServerDisconnected, or a similar connection-related exception
Validation:
  This test is necessary to ensure that the login function handles SMTP server initialization failures correctly, preventing unexpected behavior and providing appropriate feedback to users.

Scenario 4: Missing email address
Details:
  TestName: test_login_with_missing_email_address
  Description: Verify that the login function handles missing email address inputs gracefully and raises an appropriate exception.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a valid password
    - Initialize the SMTP server (s) with a valid host and port
  Act:
    - Call the login function with None or an empty string as the email address, valid password, and SMTP server object
  Assert:
    - Check that the login function raises a ValueError, TypeError, or a similar exception related to the missing input
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the login function handles missing inputs correctly, preventing unexpected behavior and providing appropriate feedback to users.

Scenario 5: Missing email password
Details:
  TestName: test_login_with_missing_email_password
  Description: Verify that the login function handles missing email password inputs gracefully and raises an appropriate exception.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a valid email address
    - Initialize the SMTP server (s) with a valid host and port
  Act:
    - Call the login function with the valid email address, None or an empty string as the password, and SMTP server object
  Assert:
    - Check that the login function raises a ValueError, TypeError, or a similar exception related to the missing input
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the login function handles missing inputs correctly, preventing unexpected behavior and providing appropriate feedback to users.
