================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-22: Path Traversal
Issue: The 'get_credentials' function uses a hardcoded file path, which could lead to path traversal attacks if the filename is user-supplied.
Solution: Validate and sanitize user-supplied input, or avoid using user-supplied input in file paths. Consider using a configuration file or environment variables for sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The 'credentials.txt' file may contain sensitive information, such as email passwords, which are stored in plaintext. This could lead to unauthorized access if the file is compromised.
Solution: Store sensitive data in a secure manner, such as using a secure hashing algorithm or encryption. Consider using libraries like 'cryptography' to securely manage sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The 'get_credentials' function does not validate the input from the 'credentials.txt' file. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the file contains invalid data.
Solution: Validate input data to ensure it meets the expected format and constraints. Use exception handling to manage unexpected input or errors.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test successful retrieval of email address and password from credentials.txt
TestName: test_get_credentials_success
Description: Verifies that the function can read the email address and password from the credentials.txt file and returns them in a tuple.
Execution:
Arrange: Ensure that the credentials.txt file is present in the same directory as the test code with valid email address and password in separate lines.
Act: Invoke the get_credentials function with the filepath parameter set to "credentials.txt".
Assert: Check if the returned tuple contains the email address and password read from the credentials.txt file.
Validation: This test is important to ensure that the function can correctly read and return the credentials from the file under normal circumstances.

Scenario 2: Test file not found error
TestName: test_get_credentials_file_not_found
Description: Verifies that the function raises a FileNotFoundError when the provided filepath does not exist.
Execution:
Arrange: Modify the filepath parameter to point to a non-existent file.
Act: Invoke the get_credentials function with the modified filepath.
Assert: Catch the FileNotFoundError and assert that the error message matches the expected message.
Validation: This test is crucial to ensure that the function handles file-related errors gracefully and informs the user when the file is not found.

Scenario 3: Test empty credentials.txt file
TestName: test_get_credentials_empty_file
Description: Verifies that the function raises an exception when the credentials.txt file is empty or does not contain the required information.
Execution:
Arrange: Modify the credentials.txt file to be empty or contain only whitespace.
Act: Invoke the get_credentials function with the filepath parameter set to "credentials.txt".
Assert: Catch the exception and assert that the error message indicates that the file is empty or does not contain the required information.
Validation: This test is important to ensure that the function can handle scenarios where the credentials.txt file is not properly formatted or does not contain the required information.

Scenario 4: Test credentials.txt file with incorrect format
TestName: test_get_credentials_incorrect_format
Description: Verifies that the function raises an exception when the credentials.txt file contains more or less than two lines.
Execution:
Arrange: Modify the credentials.txt file to contain more or less than two lines.
Act: Invoke the get_credentials function with the filepath parameter set to "credentials.txt".
Assert: Catch the exception and assert that the error message indicates that the file is not properly formatted.
Validation: This test is important to ensure that the function can handle scenarios where the credentials.txt file is not properly formatted or does not contain the required information.

Scenario 5: Test credentials.txt file with invalid email address
TestName: test_get_credentials_invalid_email
Description: Verifies that the function raises an exception when the email address in the credentials.txt file is not a valid email address.
Execution:
Arrange: Modify the credentials.txt file to contain an invalid email address.
Act: Invoke the get_credentials function with the filepath parameter set to "credentials.txt".
Assert: Catch the exception and assert that the error message indicates that the email address is not valid.
Validation: This test is important to ensure that the function can handle scenarios where the email address in the credentials.txt file is not a valid email address.
