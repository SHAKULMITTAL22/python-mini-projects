================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: User input is not being properly validated, making the application prone to injection attacks such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
Solution: Implement proper input validation using libraries like `WTForms` or `FormEncode`. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when working with databases to prevent SQL Injection attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The application may be using an insecure cryptographic algorithm for handling sensitive data. This can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access.
Solution: Use modern cryptographic algorithms and secure libraries such as `cryptography` or `PyCrypto` for handling sensitive data. Regularly review and update cryptographic algorithms to ensure they are up-to-date and secure.

Vulnerability: CWE-732: Insecure Communication
Issue: The application may not be using secure communication protocols, exposing sensitive data to eavesdropping and tampering.
Solution: Use secure communication protocols like HTTPS and TLS for all data transmission. Implement certificate validation and use strong encryption algorithms to secure communication channels.

Vulnerability: CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information
Issue: The application may be storing sensitive information like passwords or personal data in an insecure manner, making it vulnerable to data breaches.
Solution: Store sensitive data securely using encryption and secure storage mechanisms. Use secure libraries like `cryptography` or `PyCrypto` to handle encryption and decryption. Avoid storing sensitive data in plain text or in insecure locations.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Insufficient Logging & Monitoring
Issue: The application may not be logging and monitoring security-critical events, making it difficult to detect and respond to security incidents.
Solution: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring mechanisms to track security-critical events. Use security information and event management (SIEM) tools to analyze logs and detect potential security threats.
