================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not validate input data, such as customer name and phone number, allowing users to submit empty or malformed data.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that user-submitted data adheres to the expected format and length, thereby reducing the risk of data corruption and improving overall application security.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: There is no mention of encryption or hashing in the code, which could potentially expose sensitive data in transit or at rest.
Solution: Employ secure cryptographic algorithms, such as AES or SHA-256, to safeguard sensitive data from unauthorized access and ensure data integrity throughout the application's lifecycle.

Vulnerability: CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
Issue: The code uses the `os` module, which could potentially expose dangerous system-level functions to untrusted users.
Solution: Restrict or remove the usage of the `os` module, if possible, and instead opt for safer alternatives that do not grant unnecessary access to system-level resources.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Insufficient Output Encoding
Issue: The code does not appear to encode user-generated output, making it susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS) and other code injection attacks.
Solution: Implement proper output encoding to prevent unintended code execution and ensure data integrity, particularly when displaying user-generated content in the application's user interface.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Verify the correct calculation of the total bill with only medical items
Details:
TestName: test_total_bill_with_only_medical_items
Description: Verify that the total bill is calculated correctly when only medical items are purchased.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object, set the medical prices and quantities, ensure all other prices and quantities are zero.
Act: Call the bill_area() method.
Assert: Verify that the total bill is equal to the sum of medical prices multiplied by their respective quantities, plus medical taxes.
Validation: This test ensures that the medical billing logic is functioning correctly, which is essential for accurate invoicing and revenue tracking.

Scenario 2: Verify the correct calculation of the total bill with only grocery items
Details:
TestName: test_total_bill_with_only_grocery_items
Description: Verify that the total bill is calculated correctly when only grocery items are purchased.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object, set the grocery prices and quantities, ensure all other prices and quantities are zero.
Act: Call the bill_area() method.
Assert: Verify that the total bill is equal to the sum of grocery prices multiplied by their respective quantities, plus grocery taxes.
Validation: This test ensures that the grocery billing logic is functioning correctly, which is essential for accurate invoicing and revenue tracking.

Scenario 3: Verify the correct calculation of the total bill with only cold drinks
Details:
TestName: test_total_bill_with_only_cold_drinks
Description: Verify that the total bill is calculated correctly when only cold drinks are purchased.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object, set the cold drinks prices and quantities, ensure all other prices and quantities are zero.
Act: Call the bill_area() method.
Assert: Verify that the total bill is equal to the sum of cold drinks prices multiplied by their respective quantities, plus cold drinks taxes.
Validation: This test ensures that the cold drinks billing logic is functioning correctly, which is essential for accurate invoicing and revenue tracking.

Scenario 4: Verify the correct calculation of the total bill with all categories of items
Details:
TestName: test_total_bill_with_all_categories
Description: Verify that the total bill is calculated correctly when items from all categories (medical, grocery, cold drinks) are purchased.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object, set the prices and quantities for items from all categories.
Act: Call the bill_area() method.
Assert: Verify that the total bill is equal to the sum of all item prices multiplied by their respective quantities, plus taxes for all categories.
Validation: This test ensures that the billing logic for all categories is functioning correctly, which is critical for accurate invoicing and revenue tracking.

Scenario 5: Verify that an error message is displayed when customer details are missing
Details:
TestName: test_error_message_when_customer_details_missing
Description: Verify that an error message is displayed when the customer name or phone number is missing.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object, leave the customer name or phone number fields empty.
Act: Call the bill_area() method.
Assert: Verify that an error message is displayed, indicating that customer details are required.
Validation: This test ensures that the function enforces the requirement of customer details, which is important for record-keeping and communication purposes.

Scenario 6: Verify that an error message is displayed when no products are purchased
Details:
TestName: test_error_message_when_no_products_purchased
Description: Verify that an error message is displayed when no products are purchased.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object, ensure all product prices and quantities are set to zero.
Act: Call the bill_area() method.
Assert: Verify that an error message is displayed, indicating that no products have been purchased.
Validation: This test ensures that the function prevents the generation of an empty bill, which is essential for accurate invoicing and revenue tracking.

Scenario 7: Verify that the bill is saved when the process is completed
Details:
TestName: test_bill_saved_when_process_completed
Description: Verify that the bill is saved to a file when the billing process is completed.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object, set product prices and quantities, and ensure that the customer details are provided.
Act: Call the bill_area() method.
Assert: Verify that the bill has been saved to a file.
Validation: This test ensures that the function saves the bill, which is crucial for record-keeping and future reference.

Scenario 8: Verify that the bill is displayed in the text area
Details:
TestName: test_bill_displayed_in_text_area
Description: Verify that the bill is displayed in the text area when the billing process is completed.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object, set product prices and quantities, and ensure that the customer details are provided.
Act: Call the bill_area() method.
Assert: Verify that the bill is displayed in the text area, with the correct formatting and item details.
Validation: This test ensures that the function displays the bill in the text area, which is important for user feedback and communication.
