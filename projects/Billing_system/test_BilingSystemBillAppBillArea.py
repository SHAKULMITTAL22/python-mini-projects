================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CVE-2021-3177
Issue: Python string formatting with f-strings can cause potential security issues where user input is not properly sanitized, as seen in the insert(END, f"<user_input>") calls. This could lead to arbitrary code execution or a denial of service attack.
Solution: Use the format method or escape user input to prevent injection attacks.

Vulnerability: Insecure data storage
Issue: Customer details are stored in plain text variables, such as self.c_name.get() and self.c_phone.get(). This can lead to unauthorized access and data exposure.
Solution: Implement proper encryption techniques and data protection mechanisms to secure sensitive customer information.

Vulnerability: CVE-2021-29966
Issue: Using tkinter messagebox module directly can lead to a potential security risk. For example, if the self.c_name.get() or self.c_phone.get() functions are compromised, they may be able to execute arbitrary code.
Solution: Sanitize user input and use the messagebox module through a secure wrapper to limit potential attack vectors.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Verify that the bill_area method displays an error when customer name or phone number is missing
Details:
TestName: test_bill_area_missing_customer_details
Description: Check if an error message is displayed when the customer name or phone number fields are empty.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object and set the customer name or phone number to an empty string.
Act: Call the bill_area method.
Assert: Ensure that the showerror messagebox is called with the expected error message.
Validation:
This test is important to ensure that the application enforces the required customer information for billing purposes.

Scenario 2: Verify that the bill_area method displays an error when no products are purchased
Details:
TestName: test_bill_area_no_products_purchased
Description: Check if an error message is displayed when no products are selected for purchase.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object and set all product prices to "Rs. 0.0".
Act: Call the bill_area method.
Assert: Ensure that the showerror messagebox is called with the expected error message.
Validation:
This test is important to ensure that the application handles instances where no products are purchased and prevents generating an empty bill.

Scenario 5: Verify that the bill_area method calculates the cold drinks bill correctly
Details:
TestName: test_bill_area_cold_drinks_bill_calculation
Description: Check if the cold drinks bill is calculated correctly based on the selected cold drinks products and their quantities.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object and set the quantities of cold drinks products and corresponding prices. Leave all other product types unset.
Act: Call the bill_area method.
Assert: Ensure that the text area contains the correct cold drinks product entries and the total cold drinks bill is calculated accurately.
Validation:
This test is important to ensure that the application calculates the cold drinks bill correctly based on the selected products and quantities.

Scenario 6: Verify that the bill_area method applies the correct taxes for medical products
Details:
TestName: test_bill_area_medical_taxes
Description: Check if the correct medical tax is applied when medical products are purchased.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object and set the quantities of medical products and corresponding prices. Leave all other product types unset.
Act: Call the bill_area method.
Assert: Ensure that the text area contains the correct medical tax entry and the calculated tax is accurate.
Validation:
This test is important to ensure that the application applies the correct medical tax when applicable.

Scenario 7: Verify that the bill_area method applies the correct taxes for grocery products
Details:
TestName: test_bill_area_grocery_taxes
Description: Check if the correct grocery tax is applied when grocery products are purchased.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object and set the quantities of grocery products and corresponding prices. Leave all other product types unset.
Act: Call the bill_area method.
Assert: Ensure that the text area contains the correct grocery tax entry and the calculated tax is accurate.
Validation:
This test is important to ensure that the application applies the correct grocery tax when applicable.

Scenario 8: Verify that the bill_area method applies the correct taxes for cold drinks products
Details:
TestName: test_bill_area_cold_drinks_taxes
Description: Check if the correct cold drinks tax is applied when cold drinks products are purchased.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object and set the quantities of cold drinks products and corresponding prices. Leave all other product types unset.
Act: Call the bill_area method.
Assert: Ensure that the text area contains the correct cold drinks tax entry and the calculated tax is accurate.
Validation:
This test is important to ensure that the application applies the correct cold drinks tax when applicable.

Scenario 9: Verify that the bill_area method generates the total bill correctly
Details:
TestName: test_bill_area_total_bill_calculation
Description: Check if the total bill is calculated correctly based on the selected products, quantities, and taxes.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object and set the quantities of various products and corresponding prices.
Act: Call the bill_area method.
Assert: Ensure that the text area contains the correct product entries, taxes, and the total bill is calculated accurately.
Validation:
This test is important to ensure that the application calculates the total bill correctly based on the selected products, quantities, and taxes.

Scenario 10: Verify that the bill_area method saves the bill correctly
Details:
TestName: test_bill_area_save_bill
Description: Check if the bill is saved correctly after the bill_area method is called.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object and set the quantities of various products and corresponding prices. Mock the bill saving functionality.
Act: Call the bill_area method.
Assert: Ensure that the bill saving functionality is called with the correct bill information.
