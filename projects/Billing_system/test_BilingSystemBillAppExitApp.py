================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The 'messagebox.askyesno' function in 'exit_app()' method uses user input without proper validation. An attacker could potentially exploit this to execute unintended actions.
Solution: Validate user input using Python's built-in functions or libraries, like 're' for regular expressions, or implement custom validation logic as needed.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Inadequate Encryption Strength
Issue: The 'tkinter' library is used for GUI development and is not designed for secure data handling or encryption. Sensitive data may be at risk if handled within this code.
Solution: For handling sensitive data, implement strong encryption using libraries like 'cryptography' and avoid storing sensitive data within the GUI code.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Verify that the application exits when the user confirms the exit operation
TestName: test_exit_app_user_confirms_exit
Description: Confirm that the application terminates when the user agrees to exit via the messagebox.

Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object and create a root window.
Act: Call the exit_app() method of the Bill_App object.
Assert: Check that the root window has been destroyed.

Validation:
This test ensures that the application correctly terminates when the user opts to exit, fulfilling the basic requirement of the exit_app() function.

---

Scenario 2: Confirm that the application does not exit when the user cancels the exit operation
TestName: test_exit_app_user_cancels_exit
Description: Ensure that the application continues running when the user cancels the exit operation via the messagebox.

Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object and create a root window.
Act: Call the exit_app() method of the Bill_App object.
Assert: Verify that the root window has not been destroyed.

Validation:
This test case verifies that the application does not terminate prematurely when the user decides to cancel the exit operation, ensuring proper handling of user input.

---

Scenario 3: Test that the exit_app() method prompts the user with a messagebox
TestName: test_exit_app_prompts_messagebox
Description: Ensure that the exit_app() method displays a messagebox to confirm the user's intent to exit the application.

Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object and create a root window.
Act: Call the exit_app() method of the Bill_App object.
Assert: Check that a messagebox with the title "Exit" and the question "Do you really want to exit?" has been displayed.

Validation:
This test confirms that the exit_app() method communicates with the user to confirm the exit operation, which is essential for user experience and proper application termination.

---

Scenario 4: Ensure that the exit_app() method handles an invalid root window
TestName: test_exit_app_invalid_root_window
Description: Test the behavior of the exit_app() method when an invalid root window is provided during initialization.

Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object with an invalid root window.
Act: Call the exit_app() method of the Bill_App object.
Assert: Confirm that an appropriate error or exception is raised.

Validation:
This test case validates that the exit_app() method can handle unexpected input, ensuring the application's robustness and preventing potential crashes or unintended behavior.
