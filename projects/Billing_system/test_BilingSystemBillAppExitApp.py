================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The 'messagebox.askyesno' function in the 'exit_app' method can be exploited by an attacker to force the program to exit unexpectedly.
Solution: Implement proper input validation on user input before passing it to the 'exit_app' method to prevent unauthorized exiting of the application.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: No secure cryptographic algorithms are used in this code template.
Solution: Implement strong encryption algorithms, such as those provided by the hashlib library, to secure sensitive data and communication.

Vulnerability: CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resources
Issue: No permission checks are implemented in this code template.
Solution: Implement proper permission checks and access controls to secure critical resources and prevent unauthorized access.

Vulnerability: CWE-494: Critical Code Execution
Issue: The execution of critical code, such as system calls, is not properly guarded against unauthorized execution.
Solution: Implement proper authorization and authentication checks before executing critical code to prevent unauthorized execution.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing successful exit confirmation
Details:
  TestName: test_exit_app_confirm
  Description: Verifies that the exit_app function correctly confirms user's intent to exit the application.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object with a valid root window.
  Act: Call the exit_app method with no parameters.
  Assert: Check that the messagebox.askyesno method is called with appropriate arguments, and the self.root.destroy method is called.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the user is prompted to confirm their intent to exit the application, and if confirmed, the application is closed.

---

Scenario 2: Testing cancelling exit
Details:
  TestName: test_exit_app_cancel
  Description: Verifies that the exit_app function does not close the application when user cancels exit.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object with a valid root window.
  Act: Call the exit_app method with no parameters and select "No" in the confirmation dialog.
  Assert: Check that the messagebox.askyesno method is called with appropriate arguments, and the self.root.destroy method is not called.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the user is not forced to exit the application when cancelling the exit confirmation.

---

Scenario 3: Testing invalid root window
Details:
  TestName: test_exit_app_invalid_root
  Description: Verifies that the exit_app function handles an invalid root window.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object with an invalid root window (e.g., None or a non-Tkinter object).
  Act: Call the exit_app method with no parameters.
  Assert: Check that the function does not raise any exceptions.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the exit_app function can handle an invalid root window without causing any errors.

---

Scenario 4: Testing exit_app function without calling it
Details:
  TestName: test_exit_app_not_called
  Description: Verifies that the exit_app function does not close the application if not called.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object with a valid root window.
  Act: Do not call the exit_app method.
  Assert: Check that the self.root.destroy method is not called.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the exit_app function does not close the application unless explicitly called.

---

Scenario 5: Testing exit_app function with multiple calls
Details:
  TestName: test_exit_app_multiple_calls
  Description: Verifies that the exit_app function does not cause any issues when called multiple times.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object with a valid root window.
  Act: Call the exit_app method multiple times.
  Assert: Check that the messagebox.askyesno method is called only once, and the self.root.destroy method is called only once.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the exit_app function correctly handles multiple calls without causing any issues or unintended behavior.
