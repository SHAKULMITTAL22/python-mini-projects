================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The use of tkinter as a potential means for user input may expose the system to untrusted data, increasing the risk of malicious input exploitation
Solution: Validate and sanitize user input using Python's built-in functions, such as `re.sub()` and `string.punctuation`, to restrict the allowed character set and length.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: Inadequate input validation in the `exit_app` function may lead to unintended application behavior, potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate the program's flow
Solution: Implement proper validation checks for user input, ensuring that it adheres to the expected format and length. Enforce secure defaults and fail-safe conditions to minimize the impact of untrusted input.

Vulnerability: CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
Issue: The lack of synchronization between processes or threads may result in race conditions when accessing shared resources, such as files or variables, potentially causing data inconsistencies or security vulnerabilities
Solution: Implement proper synchronization mechanisms when accessing shared resources, such as using locks or semaphores, to ensure mutual exclusion and consistent data access.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test successful exit confirmation
Details:
TestName: test_exit_confirmation
Description: Verify that the user is prompted to confirm exiting the application and that the application closes upon confirmation.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App class and create a root window.
Act: Call the exit_app method and simulate a user clicking 'Yes' on the confirmation message.
Assert: Check that the root window is destroyed after the method call.
Validation: This test verifies that the exit_app method correctly prompts the user for confirmation and closes the application when confirmed.

Scenario 2: Test cancellation of exit
Details:
TestName: test_exit_cancellation
Description: Verify that the user can cancel the exit process and continue using the application.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App class and create a root window.
Act: Call the exit_app method and simulate a user clicking 'No' on the confirmation message.
Assert: Check that the root window is not destroyed after the method call.
Validation: This test verifies that the exit_app method correctly handles user cancellation and allows the user to continue using the application.

Scenario 3: Test edge case for non-boolean response
Details:
TestName: test_non_boolean_exit_confirmation
Description: Verify that the exit_app method handles non-boolean responses, such as None, from the messagebox.askyesno function.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App class and create a root window. Mock the messagebox.askyesno function to return None.
Act: Call the exit_app method.
Assert: Check that the root window is not destroyed after the method call.
Validation: This test verifies that the exit_app method handles unexpected input from the messagebox.askyesno function gracefully, preventing accidental closure of the application.

Scenario 4: Test edge case for negative response
Details:
TestName: test_negative_exit_confirmation
Description: Verify that the exit_app method handles negative responses, such as -1, from the messagebox.askyesno function.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App class and create a root window. Mock the messagebox.askyesno function to return -1.
Act: Call the exit_app method.
Assert: Check that the root window is not destroyed after the method call.
Validation: This test verifies that the exit_app method handles unexpected input from the messagebox.askyesno function gracefully, preventing accidental closure of the application.

Scenario 5: Test edge case for zero response
Details:
TestName: test_zero_exit_confirmation
Description: Verify that the exit_app method handles a zero response from the messagebox.askyesno function.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App class and create a root window. Mock the messagebox.askyesno function to return 0.
Act: Call the exit_app method.
Assert: Check that the root window is not destroyed after the method call.
Validation: This test verifies that the exit_app method handles unexpected input from the messagebox.askyesno function gracefully, preventing accidental closure of the application.
