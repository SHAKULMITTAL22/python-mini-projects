================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-732: Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Log Files
Issue: The bill number is saved as a text file, which includes sensitive information, and the file name is based on the bill number. This may expose sensitive data if the system handling the logs is compromised.
Solution: Consider hashing the bill number and using it as the file name, or encrypting the bill data before storing it in the file. Additionally, consider removing the bill number from the bill data before saving it to the file.

Vulnerability: CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
Issue: The bill data is written to a text file, and it may contain user input. If this user input is not sanitized, it could lead to log injection attacks.
Solution: Sanitize the bill data before writing it to the file, or use a secure logging library that handles sanitization automatically.

Vulnerability: CWE-284: Improper Access Control
Issue: The 'save_bill' function does not perform any access control checks, which could allow unauthorized users to save bill information.
Solution: Implement access control checks in the 'save_bill' function to ensure that only authorized users can save bill information.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Verify successful bill saving with valid input
Details:
  TestName: test_save_bill_with_valid_input
  Description: Test if the bill is saved correctly when valid input is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object and set up the required UI components. Enter some valid data in the text area.
  Act: Call the save_bill method.
  Assert: Check if the bill data is saved correctly in the specified file and if the correct message is displayed.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the core functionality of the save_bill method works as expected, ensuring that valid bills are saved without any issues.

Scenario 2: Verify user is prompted to save the bill
Details:
  TestName: test_save_bill_user_prompt
  Description: Test if the user is prompted to save the bill before actually saving it.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object and set up the required UI components. Enter some data in the text area.
  Act: Call the save_bill method.
  Assert: Check if the user is prompted with a "Save Bill" message box.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the user is given the option to save the bill before it is actually saved, preventing accidental overwrites.

Scenario 3: Verify no action is taken if the user cancels saving the bill
Details:
  TestName: test_save_bill_cancel
  Description: Test if the bill is not saved when the user cancels the save operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object and set up the required UI components. Enter some data in the text area.
  Act: Call the save_bill method and cancel the save operation when prompted.
  Assert: Check if the bill data is not saved and no message is displayed.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the save_bill method respects the user's decision to cancel the save operation, preventing unwanted bill saving.

Scenario 4: Verify bill saving fails with empty bill data
Details:
  TestName: test_save_bill_empty_data
  Description: Test if bill saving fails and an appropriate message is displayed when empty bill data is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object and set up the required UI components. Ensure the text area is empty.
  Act: Call the save_bill method.
  Assert: Check if the bill is not saved and an appropriate error message is displayed.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the save_bill method handles cases with empty bill data, ensuring that invalid bills are not saved.

Scenario 5: Verify bill saving fails with invalid bill number
Details:
  TestName: test_save_bill_invalid_bill_number
  Description: Test if bill saving fails and an appropriate message is displayed when an invalid bill number is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object and set up the required UI components. Enter some valid data in the text area. Provide an invalid bill number.
  Act: Call the save_bill method.
  Assert: Check if the bill is not saved and an appropriate error message is displayed.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the save_bill method handles cases with invalid bill numbers, ensuring that bills are saved with correct and unique identifiers.

Scenario 6: Verify bill saving fails with invalid file path
Details:
  TestName: test_save_bill_invalid_file_path
  Description: Test if bill saving fails and an appropriate message is displayed when an invalid file path is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object and set up the required UI components. Enter some valid data in the text area. Modify the file path to be invalid.
  Act: Call the save_bill method.
  Assert: Check if the bill is not saved and an appropriate error message is displayed.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the save_bill method handles cases with invalid file paths, ensuring that bills are saved in the correct location.
