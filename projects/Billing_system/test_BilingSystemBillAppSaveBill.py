Scenario 1: Test saving a bill with valid input
Scenario 2: Test user canceling the save operation
Scenario 3: Test saving a bill with an empty text area
Scenario 4: Test saving a bill with a non-writable file path
Scenario 5: Test saving a bill with a non-numeric bill number

Scenario 1: Test saving a bill with valid input
Details:
TestName: test_save_bill_with_valid_input
Description: Verify that the system can successfully save a bill when the user confirms the save operation and provides a valid bill text.
Execution:
Arrange:
- Initialize the Bill_App object
- Prepare the text area with valid bill content
- Set a numeric bill number
Act:
- Call the save_bill() method
Assert:
- Check if a file with the correct bill number is created
- Verify the bill content is saved correctly in the file
Validation:
This test is important to ensure that the primary functionality of saving a bill works as expected when the user provides valid input.

Scenario 2: Test user canceling the save operation
Details:
TestName: test_save_bill_user_cancel
Description: Verify that the system does not save a bill when the user cancels the save operation.
Execution:
Arrange:
- Initialize the Bill_App object
- Prepare the text area with valid bill content
- Set a numeric bill number
Act:
- Call the save_bill() method and select "No" when prompted to save the bill
Assert:
- Check if no file is created with the given bill number
Validation:
This test is important to ensure that the system respects the user's decision when they choose not to save the bill.

Scenario 3: Test saving a bill with an empty text area
Details:
TestName: test_save_bill_empty_text_area
Description: Verify that the system does not save a bill when the user has not entered any content in the text area.
Execution:
Arrange:
- Initialize the Bill_App object
- Clear the text area
- Set a numeric bill number
Act:
- Call the save_bill() method
Assert:
- Check if no file is created with the given bill number
Validation:
This test is important to ensure that the system does not save an empty bill when the user has not entered any content.

Scenario 4: Test saving a bill with a non-writable file path
Details:
TestName: test_save_bill_non_writable_file_path
Description: Verify that the system handles an error when trying to save a bill to a non-writable file path.
Execution:
Arrange:
- Initialize the Bill_App object
- Prepare the text area with valid bill content
- Set a numeric bill number
- Modify the file path to be non-writable
Act:
- Call the save_bill() method
Assert:
- Check for an error message indicating that the file could not be saved
Validation:
This test is important to ensure that the system handles errors gracefully when trying to save a bill to a non-writable file path.

Scenario 5: Test saving a bill with a non-numeric bill number
Details:
TestName: test_save_bill_non_numeric_bill_number
Description: Verify that the system handles an error when trying to save a bill with a non-numeric bill number.
Execution:
Arrange:
- Initialize the Bill_App object
- Prepare the text area with valid bill content
- Set a non-numeric bill number
Act:
- Call the save_bill() method
Assert:
- Check for an error message indicating that the bill number must be numeric
Validation:
This test is important to ensure that the system handles errors gracefully when trying to save a bill with a non-numeric bill number.
