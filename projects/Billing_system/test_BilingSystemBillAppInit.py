================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: Unsanitized user input in 'self.search_bill' may lead to potential security risks such as SQL injection or command injection.
Solution: Use parameterized queries, prepared statements, or ORM libraries to prevent SQL injection. For command injection, validate and sanitize user input using built-in Python functions or libraries.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Insecure Transport Layer Protocol
Issue: No encryption or secure communication channel is used for transmitting sensitive data.
Solution: Implement Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to secure the communication channel between the client and the server.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Path Traversal
Issue: Unvalidated user input in 'os.system' command may lead to path traversal attacks.
Solution: Validate and sanitize user input before passing it to the 'os.system' command. Consider using safer alternatives like 'subprocess.run' with appropriate arguments.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Initialize the Bill_App class with a valid root
Details:
  TestName: test_init_class_valid_root
  Description: Verify that the Bill_App class is correctly initialized with a valid root, setting the window title, geometry, and background color.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid Tk root object.
  Act: Initialize the Bill_App class with the root object.
  Assert: Check that the window title, geometry, and background color are set as expected.
Validation: Proper initialization ensures that the application window is correctly displayed with the desired settings.

Scenario 2: Initialize the Bill_App class with a non-Tk root
Details:
  TestName: test_init_class_invalid_root
  Description: Verify that an exception is raised when the Bill_App class is initialized with a non-Tk root object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Pass a non-Tk object as the root parameter during class initialization.
  Act: Attempt to initialize the Bill_App class with the non-Tk object.
  Assert: Confirm that a TypeError or a similar exception is raised.
Validation: Raising an exception for an invalid root ensures that the application does not continue with incorrect behavior.

Scenario 3: Access and modify the Bill_App instance variables
Details:
  TestName: test_instance_variable_access_and_modification
  Description: Verify that the instance variables of the Bill_App class can be accessed and modified after initialization.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App class with a valid root.
  Act: Access and modify the instance variables, such as self.c_name and self.medical_price.
  Assert: Confirm that the instance variables can be accessed and modified as expected.
Validation: Accessing and modifying instance variables allows for customization and control of the application's behavior.

Scenario 4: Test the total() method with valid input
Details:
  TestName: test_total_method_valid_input
  Description: Verify that the total() method correctly calculates the total price based on the input values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App class with a valid root. Set the instance variables to specific values.
  Act: Call the total() method.
  Assert: Check that the medical_price, grocery_price, and cold_drinks_price instance variables are updated correctly.
Validation: Accurate price calculation is essential for displaying the correct total and generating the correct bill.

Scenario 5: Test the total() method with zero input
Details:
  TestName: test_total_method_zero_input
  Description: Verify that the total() method correctly calculates the total price as zero when all input values are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App class with a valid root. Set the instance variables to zero.
  Act: Call the total() method.
  Assert: Check that the medical_price, grocery_price, and cold_drinks_price instance variables are updated to zero.
Validation: Accurate price calculation ensures that the application handles zero input values correctly, preventing incorrect totals and bills.

Scenario 6: Test the bill_area() method with valid input
Details:
  TestName: test_bill_area_method_valid_input
  Description: Verify that the bill_area() method correctly displays the total price and tax in the text area.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App class with a valid root. Set the instance variables to specific values.
  Act: Call the bill_area() method.
  Assert: Check that the text area displays the correct total price and tax information.
Validation: Properly displaying the bill information ensures that the user can review and confirm the total price and tax before generating the final bill.

Scenario 7: Test the bill_area() method with zero input
Details:
  TestName: test_bill_area_method_zero_input
  Description: Verify that the bill_area() method correctly displays zero when all input values are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App class with a valid root. Set the instance variables to zero.
  Act: Call the bill_area() method.
  Assert: Check that the text area displays zero for the total price and tax.
Validation: Properly handling zero input values in the bill_area() method ensures consistent and accurate bill information, even when there are no items in the cart.

Scenario 8: Test the clear_data() method
Details:
  TestName: test_clear_data_method
  Description: Verify that the clear_data() method correctly resets the instance variables and text area to their initial state.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App class with a valid root. Set the instance variables to specific values.
  Act: Call the clear_data() method.
  Assert: Check that the instance variables are reset to their initial state and the text area is cleared.
Validation: Clearing the data allows the user to start a new bill, ensuring that previous data does not interfere with new calculations.

Scenario 9: Test the exit_app() method
Details:
  TestName: test_exit_app_method
  Description: Verify that the exit_app() method closes the application window when called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App class with a valid root.
  Act: Call the exit_app() method.
  Assert: Confirm that the application window is closed.
Validation: Properly closing the application window when the user clicks the Exit button ensures a clean and expected exit from the program.

Scenario 10: Test the find_bill() method with a valid bill number
Details:
  TestName: test_find_bill_method_valid_bill_number
  Description: Verify that the find_bill() method correctly retrieves and displays the bill information for a valid bill number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App class with a valid root. Create a bill with a specific bill number and save it.
  Act: Call the find_bill() method with the valid bill number.
  Assert: Check that the text area displays the correct bill information.
Validation: Accurately retrieving and displaying bill information ensures that users can review past bills and verify their accuracy.

Scenario 11: Test the find_bill() method with an invalid bill number
Details:
  TestName: test_find_bill_method_invalid_bill_number
  Description: Verify that the find_bill() method correctly handles an invalid bill number, displaying an appropriate error message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App class with a valid root. Ensure that the bill number does not exist in the saved bills.
  Act: Call the find_bill() method with the invalid bill number.
  Assert: Check that the text area displays an error message indicating that the bill was not found.
Validation: Proper error handling for invalid bill numbers ensures that users are informed of any issues and can take appropriate action.

Scenario 12: Test the __init__() method with invalid parameters
Details:
  TestName: test_init_method_invalid_parameters
  Description: Verify that the __init__() method raises a TypeError or a similar exception when initialized with invalid parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Pass invalid parameters during class initialization, such as non-Tk objects or incorrect data types.
  Act: Attempt to initialize the Bill_App class with the invalid parameters.
  Assert: Confirm that a TypeError or a similar exception is raised.
Validation: Raising an exception for invalid parameters ensures that the application does not continue with incorrect behavior.
