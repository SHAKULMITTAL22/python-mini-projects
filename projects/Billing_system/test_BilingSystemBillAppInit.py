Scenario 1: Verify correct initialization of the Bill_App object
Details:
  TestName: test_init_bill_app
  Description: Test the initialization of the Bill_App object with a valid root window.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid tkinter Tk object as the root window.
  Act: Instantiate the Bill_App class with the root window as the parameter.
  Assert: Verify that the root window's title, geometry, and background color are set correctly. Check that all necessary variables, frames, labels, buttons, and entries are created and displayed in the main window.
Validation:
  Rationalize: The test ensures that the Bill_App object is correctly initialized with the required GUI elements and variables, allowing for proper user interaction and functionality.

Scenario 2: Verify correct population of the customer details frame
Details:
  TestName: test_customer_details_frame
  Description: Test that the customer details frame is correctly populated with labels, text entry fields, and a search button.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the Bill_App class with a valid root window.
  Act: Access the F1 frame containing customer details.
  Assert: Verify that the correct number and alignment of labels, text entry fields, and the search button are present in the F1 frame.
Validation:
  Rationalize: The test ensures that the customer details frame is correctly populated, allowing users to input their information and search for bills.

Scenario 3: Verify correct population of the medical purpose frame
Details:
  TestName: test_medical_purpose_frame
  Description: Test that the medical purpose frame is correctly populated with labels, text entry fields, and individual product prices.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the Bill_App class with a valid root window.
  Act: Access the F2 frame containing medical items.
  Assert: Verify that the correct number and alignment of labels, text entry fields, and individual product prices are present in the F2 frame.
Validation:
  Rationalize: The test ensures that the medical purpose frame is correctly populated, allowing users to input quantities for medical items and view their prices.

[Additional scenarios to be added, following the same format and approach, covering other frames, buttons, text entry fields, and functionality.]
