"""
1. Scenario: Check if all variables are initialized correctly.
    - Given: The billing system is initialized
    - Then: Confirm that all variables are properly initialized.

2. Scenario: Check if the root geometry and title are properly set.
    - Given: The billing system is initialized
    - Then: Confirm that the geometry and title of the root window are set as "1350x700+0+0" and "Billing Software" respectively.

3. Scenario: Check if billing number is uniquely generated.
    - Given: The billing system is initialized multiple times
    - Then: Confirm that each run generates a unique billing number.

4. Scenario: Check if all labels and entries for customer details are created and placed correctly.
    - Given: The billing system is initialized
    - Then: Confirm that all Labels and Entry fields required for capturing Customer details (Customer name, phone number, and bill number) are set up and placed properly.

5. Scenario: Check if all labels and entries for medical products are created and placed correctly.
    - Given: The billing system is initialized
    - Then: Confirm that all Labels and Entry fields for medical products are set up and placed correctly.

6. Scenario: Check if all labels and entries for grocery items and cold drinks are created and placed correctly.
    - Given: The billing system is initialized
    - Then: Confirm that all Labels and Entry fields for grocery items and cold drinks are set up and placed correctly.

7. Scenario: Check for proper placement of bill area and button frame.
    - Given: The billing system is initialized
    - Then: Confirm that the bill area and button frame are placed correctly.

8. Scenario: Check for the creation and placement of all action buttons (Total, Generate bill, Clear, and Exit).
    - Given: The billing system is initialized
    - Then: Confirm that all action buttons are created and placed correctly.

9. Scenario: Check if the billing area is scrollable.
    - Given: The billing system is initialized and multiple items added to generate lengthy bill
    - Then: Confirm that scrollbar in the billing area works correctly and is able to scroll through the lengthy bill. 

10. Scenario: Check if the Total, Generate bill, Clear, and Exit buttons function correctly. 
    - Given: The billing system is initialized and the various buttons are clicked
    - Then: Confirm that clicking the Total, Generate bill, Clear, and Exit buttons triggers the expected functionalities.
