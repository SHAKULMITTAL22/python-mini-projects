================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-215: Information Exposure through Debug Information
Issue: Explicit display of exception tracebacks may lead to sensitive information disclosure, which can aid an attacker in understanding the application's structure and logic.
Solution: Implement proper error handling and logging using Python's `logging` module, and ensure that debug outputs are disabled in production environments.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: Python's `hashlib` module is used for cryptographic purposes, but the code snippet does not provide any indication of its use in this context. Insecure cryptographic practices can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access.
Solution: Ensure that all cryptographic operations are performed using secure algorithms, such as SHA-256 or greater for hashing, and AES for encryption. Additionally, use built-in libraries and functions, such as `hashlib` and `secrets`, whenever possible, and avoid implementing custom cryptographic solutions.

Vulnerability: CWE-494: Dependency Confusion
Issue: The code snippet imports several third-party packages (e.g., `tkinter`, `random`, `os`) without specifying their exact versions, which can lead to dependency confusion attacks if a malicious actor publishes a package with the same name as one of the dependencies.
Solution: Always specify the exact versions of third-party packages in the application's `requirements.txt` file, and use a virtual environment to isolate the application's dependencies from the system's global packages.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test the correct calculation of medical prices

Details:
  TestName: test_total_medical_price_calculation

  Act: Call the total() function.
  Assert: Check if the cold drinks price and total bill are updated correctly.

Validation:
  Rationalize: The test is crucial to ensure that the total cold drinks price is calculated accurately, which is essential for generating the correct total bill.

---

Scenario 6: Test the addition of 10% tax on cold drinks prices

Details:
  TestName: test_cold_drinks_tax_calculation
  Description: This test verifies that a 10% tax is added to the total cold drinks price.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object, set individual cold drinks product prices, and calculate the total cold drinks price.
  Act: Call the total() function.
  Assert: Check if the cold drinks tax is calculated as 10% of the total cold drinks price.
