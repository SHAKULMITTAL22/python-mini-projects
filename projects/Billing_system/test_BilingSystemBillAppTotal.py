================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure third-party packages
Issue: The code uses tkinter without specifying a minimum version, which may lead to unintended behavior or vulnerabilities from outdated versions.
Solution: Specify a minimum version for tkinter to ensure a secure and predictable environment.

Vulnerability: Cross-site scripting (CWE-79)
Issue: The code uses String concatenation for constructing dynamic SQL queries, making it vulnerable to Cross-site scripting attacks.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent potential Cross-site scripting attacks.

Vulnerability: Input validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The code lacks input validation for user-provided data, allowing attackers to inject malicious data.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure user-provided data is safe and expected.

Vulnerability: Insecure random number generation (CWE-330)
Issue: The code uses the random module for generating random numbers, which may not be cryptographically secure.
Solution: Use the secrets module or a similar cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG).

Vulnerability: Path traversal (CWE-22)
Issue: The code does not sanitize user-provided file paths, making it vulnerable to path traversal attacks.
Solution: Sanitize user-provided file paths to prevent unauthorized access to the file system.

Vulnerability: Insecure Deserialization (CWE-502)
Issue: The code uses pickle for serializing and deserializing data, which can be exploited if untrusted data is received.
Solution: Avoid using pickle for handling untrusted data. Consider using a safer alternative like JSON or XML.
