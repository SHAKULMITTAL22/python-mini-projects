================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: SQL Injection
Issue: The code snippet does not show any SQL injection protection measures. An attacker could potentially manipulate user input, leading to unauthorized access or data corruption.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate SQL code from user input. This ensures that user input is always treated as literal data, not executable code.

Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: The code snippet does not appear to validate user input. Invalid or malicious input could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Implement input validation checks to ensure user input meets specific criteria before processing it. This includes checking data types, length, format, and range.

Vulnerability: Use of Third-Party Packages
Issue: The code snippet imports the tkinter and random modules without any explicit validation. This could lead to potential security issues if the packages are not trustworthy.
Solution: Always validate and verify third-party packages before using them. Check for known vulnerabilities, use official package repositories, and keep packages up-to-date.

Vulnerability: Hardcoded Paths
Issue: The code snippet contains hardcoded paths (e.g., 'from tkinter import *'). This could lead to path traversal attacks if the code is used in a web application context.
Solution: Avoid using hardcoded paths in your code. Instead, use relative paths or allow users to specify the path at runtime, ensuring proper sanitization and validation.
