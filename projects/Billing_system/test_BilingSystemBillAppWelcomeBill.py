================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not properly validate or sanitize user inputs, specifically in the `welcome_bill` function where user inputs are directly concatenated into strings. This can lead to issues such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or SQL Injection (SQLi) if this data is later used in a web or database context.
Solution: Validate and sanitize user inputs using libraries such as `bleach` for HTML sanitization or `Werkzeug`'s `secure_filename` for file upload sanitization. Additionally, use parameterized queries when interacting with databases to prevent SQLi.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Insecure Cryptographic Storage
Issue: The code does not appear to use any cryptographic functions, which can lead to sensitive data being stored insecurely. This can result in data breaches or unauthorized access to sensitive information.
Solution: Use strong encryption algorithms like AES or RSA, and ensure proper key management. It is recommended to use established libraries like `cryptography` or `pycryptodome` for cryptographic operations.

Vulnerability: CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere
Issue: The code imports the `random` and `os` modules, as well as the `messagebox` function from `tkinter`, without checking their integrity. This can lead to the execution of malicious code if these modules have been tampered with or are from untrusted sources.
Solution: Only use modules from trusted sources, and verify their integrity using digital signatures or secure hashes. Additionally, consider using virtual environments to isolate the project and its dependencies.
