================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-22, Path Traversal
Issue: User-supplied input is directly used in the file path generation, enabling potential path traversal attacks.
Solution: Validate input and restrict file paths to a specific directory. Use whitelisting or sanitization to ensure user input does not contain malicious path traversal sequences.

Vulnerability: CWE-78, OS Command Injection
Issue: The 'os.listdir()' function can be exploited for arbitrary command injection, leading to unintended system actions.
Solution: Avoid using 'os.listdir()' with user-supplied input. Use Python's built-in 'glob' module or 'os.path' for safe file path manipulation.

Vulnerability: CWE-327, Inadequate Encryption Strength
Issue: No encryption is used when storing or transmitting sensitive data, making it susceptible to unauthorized access.
Solution: Implement secure encryption, such as AES, for sensitive data storage and transmission. Use Python's 'cryptography' library for secure encryption.

Vulnerability: CWE-732, Insecure Communication
Issue: No encryption is used when storing or transmitting sensitive data, making it susceptible to network eavesdropping.
Solution: Implement secure encryption, such as TLS, for network communication. Use Python's 'ssl' library for secure network communication.

Vulnerability: CWE-319, Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
Issue: No encryption is used when storing sensitive data, making it susceptible to unauthorized access.
Solution: Implement secure encryption, such as AES, for sensitive data storage. Use Python's 'cryptography' library for secure encryption.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test successful bill retrieval
Details:
TestName: test_find_bill_successful
Description: Verify that the function can successfully find and display a bill when provided with a valid bill number.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize an instance of Bill_App and create a sample bill file in the "bills/" directory.
Act: Invoke the find_bill method with a valid bill number.
Assert: Confirm that the text area contains the contents of the bill file and the "present" variable is set to "yes".
Validation: This test is essential to ensure that the primary functionality of the function works as expected, enabling users to find and display bills.

Scenario 2: Test invalid bill number
Details:
TestName: test_find_bill_invalid_bill_number
Description: Verify that the function handles an invalid bill number correctly.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize an instance of Bill_App and ensure there are no files with the specified bill number in the "bills/" directory.
Act: Invoke the find_bill method with an invalid bill number.
Assert: Confirm that the text area is empty and the "present" variable is set to "no".
Validation: This test is crucial to ensure that the function can gracefully handle situations where a user enters an incorrect or non-existent bill number.

Scenario 3: Test bill number case sensitivity
Details:
TestName: test_find_bill_case_sensitivity
Description: Verify that the function is case-sensitive when searching for bill numbers.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize an instance of Bill_App, create a sample bill file with a capitalized bill number in the "bills/" directory.
Act: Invoke the find_bill method with a lowercase version of the bill number.
Assert: Confirm that the text area is empty and the "present" variable is set to "no".
Validation: This test is important to ensure that the function's behavior is consistent and predictable when dealing with different capitalizations of bill numbers.

Scenario 4: Test multiple bills with the same number
Details:
TestName: test_find_bill_multiple_bills
Description: Verify that the function can find and display a specific bill when there are multiple bills with the same number in the "bills/" directory.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize an instance of Bill_App, create multiple sample bill files with the same bill number in the "bills/" directory.
Act: Invoke the find_bill method with the shared bill number.
Assert: Confirm that the text area contains the contents of the correct bill file and the "present" variable is set to "yes".
Validation: This test is necessary to ensure that the function can correctly handle and display the desired bill when there are multiple files with the same bill number.

Scenario 5: Test bill file format
Details:
TestName: test_find_bill_file_format
Description: Verify that the function can handle different file formats when searching for bills.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize an instance of Bill_App, create a sample bill file with a non-text format (e.g., PDF, DOCX) in the "bills/" directory.
Act: Invoke the find_bill method with the bill number.
Assert: Confirm that the function handles the non-text file gracefully and sets the "present" variable to "no".
Validation: This test is crucial to ensure that the function can handle different file formats and avoid unexpected behavior or errors when attempting to read non-text files.
