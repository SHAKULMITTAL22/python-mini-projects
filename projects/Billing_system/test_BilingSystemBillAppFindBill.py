================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The application uses user-supplied input (self.search_bill.get()) in a path without proper validation, allowing an attacker to access arbitrary files outside the intended directory.
Solution: Validate and sanitize the user-supplied input to ensure it does not contain '..' or '/' characters. Use os.path.join() to construct the file path, ensuring the user-supplied input is treated as a single path component.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Inadequate Encryption Strength
Issue: The application uses the tkinter and random libraries for handling sensitive data. These libraries are not designed for secure data handling and encryption, making the application susceptible to data breaches.
Solution: Use a secure library like cryptography (https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) for handling sensitive data. Implement strong encryption algorithms and secure random number generators to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Search for an existing bill
TestName: test_find_existing_bill
Description: This test verifies that the function correctly displays the content of an existing bill when the bill number matches an existing file.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Initialize the Bill_App object
    - Create a sample bill file (e.g., "bills/bill1.txt") with some content
    - Set the search_bill attribute to the name of the sample bill file (e.g., "bill1")
  Act:
    - Call the find_bill() method
  Assert:
    - Verify that the text area contains the content of the sample bill file
    - Verify that the "present" variable is set to "yes"

Validation:
  By testing this scenario, we ensure that the function correctly reads and displays the content of an existing bill file.

---

Scenario 2: Search for a non-existing bill
TestName: test_find_non_existing_bill
Description: This test verifies that the function correctly shows an error message when the bill number does not match any existing file.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Initialize the Bill_App object
    - Set the search_bill attribute to a non-existing bill number
  Act:
    - Call the find_bill() method
  Assert:
    - Verify that an error message is displayed with the text "Invalid Bill No"

Validation:
  By testing this scenario, we ensure that the function handles non-existing bill files gracefully and provides appropriate feedback to the user.

---

Scenario 3: Search for a bill with invalid file format
TestName: test_find_bill_with_invalid_file_format
Description: This test verifies that the function correctly ignores files with invalid formats (e.g., without the ".txt" extension) during the search.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Initialize the Bill_App object
    - Create a sample bill file with an invalid format (e.g., "bills/bill1.pdf")
    - Set the search_bill attribute to the name of the sample bill file (e.g., "bill1")
  Act:
    - Call the find_bill() method
  Assert:
    - Verify that the text area does not contain the content of the sample bill file
    - Verify that the "present" variable is set to "no"

Validation:
  By testing this scenario, we ensure that the function only considers files with the correct format during the search.

---

Scenario 4: Search for a bill with an empty search_bill attribute
TestName: test_find_bill_with_empty_search_bill_attribute
Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles an empty search_bill attribute and does not raise any exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Initialize the Bill_App object
    - Set the search_bill attribute to an empty string
  Act:
    - Call the find_bill() method
  Assert:
    - Verify that no exceptions are raised

Validation:
  By testing this scenario, we ensure that the function handles an empty search_bill attribute gracefully and does not cause any unexpected behavior.
