================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not properly validate user input in the `find_bill` method. An attacker could provide a specially crafted input that leads to a directory traversal attack, potentially allowing them to read arbitrary files on the system.
Solution: Validate user input to ensure it only contains expected characters and is within the allowed length. Use a library like `pathvalidate` to ensure the input does not contain path traversal patterns, and limit the input to the expected format (e.g., alphanumeric characters and underscores).

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Insecure Dependency
Issue: The code uses the `tkinter` and `os` libraries without pinning their versions. An attacker could exploit this by replacing the libraries with malicious versions or by exploiting known vulnerabilities in unpatched versions.
Solution: Pin the versions of third-party libraries in your `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile` to ensure that only trusted versions are used. Regularly review and update these dependencies to ensure they remain secure and up-to-date.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful bill retrieval
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_bill_retrieval
  Description: Verify that the function correctly retrieves and displays a bill when a valid bill number is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object and create a test bill file in the expected format and location.
  Act: Call the find_bill method with a valid bill number.
  Assert: Check that the bill text area contains the correct bill information.
Validation:
  It is essential to ensure that the function can successfully retrieve and display bills when provided with valid bill numbers to meet the primary business requirement.

Scenario 2: Invalid bill number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_bill_number
  Description: Verify that the function displays an error message when an invalid bill number is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object.
  Act: Call the find_bill method with an invalid bill number.
  Assert: Check that the error message is displayed and the bill text area remains empty.
Validation:
  Validating error handling for invalid bill numbers ensures that users are informed of incorrect inputs and prevents unexpected behavior.

Scenario 3: Bill number format validation
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_bill_number_format
  Description: Verify that the function handles invalid bill number formats, such as non-numeric or mixed inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object.
  Act: Call the find_bill method with various invalid bill number formats.
  Assert: Check that the error message is displayed and the bill text area remains empty for each test case.
Validation:
  Ensuring that the function can handle various invalid bill number formats reduces the risk of unexpected behavior and reinforces user input validation.

Scenario 4: Case-insensitive bill number search
Details:
  TestName: test_case_insensitive_bill_number_search
  Description: Verify that the function can find bills with case-insensitive bill numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object and create a test bill file with a mixed-case bill number.
  Act: Call the find_bill method with the mixed-case bill number.
  Assert: Check that the bill text area contains the correct bill information.
Validation:
  Case-insensitive bill number search improves user experience and reduces the likelihood of user error when searching for bills.

Scenario 5: Empty bill directory
Details:
  TestName: test_empty_bill_directory
  Description: Verify that the function handles an empty bills directory gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the Bill_App object and ensure the bills directory is empty.
  Act: Call the find_bill method with any bill number.
  Assert: Check that the error message is displayed and the bill text area remains empty.
Validation:
  Handling an empty bills directory gracefully ensures that the application remains stable and informative when no bills are available for retrieval.
