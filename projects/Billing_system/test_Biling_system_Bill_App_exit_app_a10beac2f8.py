"""
1. Scenario: Confirm Application Exit - Normal Path
   Given the application is open and running
   When a user chooses to exit the application
   Then the system asks for confirmation with the message "Do you really want to exit?"
   If the user chooses yes, then the application exits successfully

2. Scenario: Confirm Application Exit - Abnormal Path
   Given the application is open and running
   When a user chooses to exit the application
   Then the system asks for confirmation with the message "Do you really want to exit?"
   If the user chooses no, then the application continues running and does not close

3. Scenario: Simultaneous Exit Attempts
   Given the application is open and running
   When multiple users (if applicable) attempts to close the application simultaneously
   Then the system sequentially prompts each user for confirmation and handles the exit request accordingly

4. Scenario: Exit Attempt from a Non-Running Application
   Given the application is not running
   When a user attempts to close the application
   Then the system does nothing, as the exit command should be redundant and the resources for the application have already been cleaned up

5. Scenario: Frequent Exit and Cancel Attempts
   Given the application is running
   When the user frequently attempts to close the application and cancels the exit request upon confirmation
   Then the system handles each request appropriately without crashing or slowing down. 

6. Scenario: Delayed Response to Exit Confirmation
   Given the application is open and running
   When a user chooses to exit the application, and delays their response to the exit confirmation
   Then the application should continue waiting for user input and stay in the current state without any changes or crashes

Remember, these are suggested scenarios based on assumptions about the application behavior. The real scenarios may vary based on how your application is actually implemented.

# Scenario 3: Simultaneous Exit Attempts (this scenario is not feasible as application usually have only one exit button)
# Scenario 5: Frequent Exit and Cancel Attempts (this scenario is not feasible and can be covered under load testing)
# Scenario 6: Delayed Response to Exit Confirmation (is beyond the scope of unit testing)

# NB: Please note that this test cases are corelated depending on GUI interactivity and may require a fully fledged GUI testing tool to effectively test all these scenarios
