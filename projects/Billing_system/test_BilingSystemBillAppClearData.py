================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The 'clear_data' function sets various attributes to 0 without checking if the attributes are numeric, allowing potential attackers to cause a Type Error.
Solution: Add checks to ensure that the attributes being set to 0 are numeric before performing the assignment.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The 'random.randint' function is used to generate a bill number, which may not provide sufficient randomness and could potentially be guessed by an attacker.
Solution: Replace 'random.randint' with a more secure random number generator, such as 'secrets.randbelow' or 'os.urandom'.

Vulnerability: CWE-732: Insecure Communication
Issue: The code does not appear to use HTTPS for network communication, potentially exposing sensitive data in transit.
Solution: Use HTTPS instead of HTTP for all network communication to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
